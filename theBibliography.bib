    abstract         = {High-γ amplitude (80–150 Hz) represents motor information, such as movement types, on the sensorimotor cortex. In several cortical areas, high-γ amplitudes are coupled with low-frequency phases, e.g., α and θ (phase–amplitude coupling, PAC). However, such coupling has not been studied in the sensorimotor cortex; thus, its potential functional role has yet to be explored. We investigated PAC of high-γ amplitude in the sensorimotor cortex during waiting for and the execution of movements using electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings in humans. ECoG signals were recorded from the sensorimotor cortices of 4 epilepsy patients while they performed three different hand movements. A subset of electrodes showed high-γ activity selective to movement type around the timing of motor execution, while the same electrodes showed nonselective high-γ activity during the waiting period ({\textgreater}2 s before execution). Cross frequency coupling analysis revealed that the high-γ amplitude during waiting was strongly coupled with the α phase (10–14 Hz) at the electrodes with movement-selective high-γ amplitudes during execution. This coupling constituted the high-γ amplitude peaking around the trough of the α oscillation, and its strength and phase were not predictive of movement type. As the coupling attenuated toward the timing of motor execution, the high-γ amplitude appeared to be released from the α phase to build a motor representation with phase-independent activity. Our results suggest that PAC modulates motor representation in the sensorimotor cortex by holding and releasing high-γ activity in movement-selective cortical regions.},

More recently, theta and gamma oscillations were also reported to exhibit phase-phase coupling, or n:m phase-locking, suggesting an important mechanism of neuronal coding that has long received theoretical support. However, by analyzing simulated and actual LFPs, here we question the existence of theta-gamma phase-phase coupling in the rat hippocampus. We show that the quasi-linear phase shifts introduced by filtering lead to spurious coupling levels in both white noise and hippocampal LFPs, which highly depend on epoch length, and that significant coupling may be falsely detected when employing improper surrogate methods. We also show that waveform asymmetry and frequency harmonics may generate artifactual n:m phase-locking. Studies investigating phase-phase coupling should rely on appropriate statistical controls and be aware of confounding factors; otherwise, they could easily fall into analysis pitfalls.},

However, characterizing these states is complicated by the fact that different oscillations are often coupled, such as gamma oscillations nested in theta in the hippocampus, and changes in coupling are thought to reflect distinct states. Here, we describe a new method to separate single oscillatory cycles into distinct states based on frequency and phase coupling. Using this method, we identified four theta-gamma coupling states in rat hippocampal CA1. These states differed in abundance across behaviors, phase synchrony with other hippocampal subregions, and neural coding properties suggesting that these states are functionally distinct. We captured cycle-to-cycle changes in oscillatory coupling states and found frequent switching between theta-gamma states showing that the hippocampus rapidly shifts between different functional states. This method provides a new approach to investigate oscillatory brain dynamics broadly.},

This study developed an algorithm for the detection of respiratory events based on impulse-radio ultra-wideband radar and verified its feasibility for the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea. A total of 94 subjects were enrolled in this study (23 controls and 24, 14, and 33 with mild, moderate, and severe obstructive sleep apnea, respectively). Abnormal breathing detected by impulse-radio ultra-wideband radar was defined as a drop in the peak radar signal by ≥30\% from that in the pre-event baseline. We compared the abnormal breathing index obtained from impulse-radio ultra-wideband radar and apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) measured from polysomnography. There was an excellent agreement between the Abnormal Breathing Index and AHI (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.927). The overall agreements of the impulse-radio ultra-wideband radar were 0.93 for Model 1 (AHI ≥ 5), 0.91 for Model 2 (AHI ≥ 15), and 1 for Model 3 (AHI ≥ 30). Impulse-radio ultra-wideband radar accurately detected respiratory events (apneas and hypopneas) during sleep without subject contact. Therefore, impulse-radio ultra-wideband radar may be used as a screening tool for obstructive sleep apnea.},

    abstract         = {Data preprocessing is a crucial step for mining and learning from data, and one of its primary activities is the transformation of data. This activity is very important in the context of time series prediction since most time series models assume the property of stationarity, i.e., statistical properties do not change over time, which in practice is the exception and not the rule in most real datasets. There are several transformation methods designed to treat nonstationarity in time series. However, the choice of a transformation that is appropriate to the adopted data model and to the problem at hand is not a simple task. This paper provides a review and experimental analysis of methods for transformation of nonstationary time series. The focus of this work is to provide a background on the subject and a discussion on their advantages and limitations to the problem of time series prediction. A subset of the reviewed transformation methods is compared through an experimental evaluation using benchmark datasets from time series prediction competitions and other real macroeconomic datasets. Suitable nonstationary time series transformation methods provided improvements of more than 30\% in prediction accuracy for half of the evaluated time series and improved the prediction in more than 95\% for 10\% of the time series. Furthermore, the adoption of a validation phase during model training enables the selection of suitable transformation methods.},

    abstract         = {Many complex and interesting phenomena in nature are due to nonlinear phenomena. The theory of nonlinear dynamical systems, also called ‘chaos theory’, has now progressed to a stage, where it becomes possible to study self-organization and pattern formation in the complex neuronal networks of the brain. One approach to nonlinear time series analysis consists of reconstructing, from time series of EEG or MEG, an attractor of the underlying dynamical system, and characterizing it in terms of its dimension (an estimate of the degrees of freedom of the system), or its Lyapunov exponents and entropy (reflecting unpredictability of the dynamics due to the sensitive dependence on initial conditions). More recently developed nonlinear measures characterize other features of local brain dynamics (forecasting, time asymmetry, determinism) or the nonlinear synchronization between recordings from different brain regions. Nonlinear time series has been applied to EEG and MEG of healthy subjects during no-task resting states, perceptual processing, performance of cognitive tasks and different sleep stages. Many pathologic states have been examined as well, ranging from toxic states, seizures, and psychiatric disorders to Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Cre1utzfeldt-Jakob's disease. Interpretation of these results in terms of ‘functional sources’ and ‘functional networks’ allows the identification of three basic patterns of brain dynamics: (i) normal, ongoing dynamics during a no-task, resting state in healthy subjects; this state is characterized by a high dimensional complexity and a relatively low and fluctuating level of synchronization of the neuronal networks; (ii) hypersynchronous, highly nonlinear dynamics of epileptic seizures; (iii) dynamics of degenerative encephalopathies with an abnormally low level of between area synchronization. Only intermediate levels of rapidly fluctuating synchronization, possibly due to critical dynamics near a phase transition, are associated with normal information processing, whereas both hyper—as well as hyposynchronous states result in impaired information processing and disturbed consciousness.},

This paper develops a temperature-dependent, stage-based, discrete, cohort model of the population dynamics of an insect pest under pressure from a predator. Guided by experimental data, the model is applied specifically to predation of grasshoppers by rangeland lycosid spiders. The development rate of insect arthropods is strongly affected by temperature, and these temperature-dependent phenological effects couple with shifts in the daily activity periods for both prey and predator, thereby increasing or decreasing opportunities for interaction. The model addresses these effects quantitatively by introducing a temperature-dependent, joint-activity factor that enters the predator’s functional response. The model also includes a prey mortality rate that is temperature-dependent through the prey development rate. The model is parameterized using field and experimental data for spiders and grasshoppers. We investigate the effect of the solar power index (sunlight), mean temperature, and temperature variation, as measured by amplitude, on the developmental times and survivorship both with, and without, predation. We conclude that increasing variation in temperature results in a stronger relative effect on survivorship due to predation.},

While an increasing number of empirical studies have shown that environmental changes can alter the strengths of species interactions, these studies are typically short ({\textless}1–2 generations) and therefore give only partial information about longer term population dynamics. To focus on longer term dynamics, we investigated population cycles of pea aphids and their most common parasitoid, Aphidius ervi, in Wisconsin, USA. Data collected over three years in alfalfa fields showed an apparent host–parasitoid population cycle. Furthermore, higher pea aphid population growth rates and increased parasitism were correlated with higher naturally occurring temperatures. While these effects were observed with seasonal fluctuations in temperature, they beg the question of how long-term changes in mean annual temperature might change aphid–parasitoid population cycles, a question which we further pursued with laboratory experiments. To quantify temperature-dependent demographic parameters, we used short-term ({\textless}1 generation) experiments conducted at 20°C and 27°C. The higher temperature increased aphid and parasitoid development rates, adult aphid life span and fecundity, and parasitoid attack rates. We then conducted multi-generation population-level laboratory experiments to reveal the effects of temperature (20°C vs. 27°C) on population dynamics. We fit the resulting time series data using a nonlinear age-structured state-space model to estimate population-level processes that could not be estimated in short-term laboratory experiments. Using the model, we parsed out the demographic rates that had the largest impacts on aphid–parasitoid population cycles. This analysis showed that there were frequent contrasts in the effects of temperature operating through different demographic rates. For example, the temperature-dependent increase in aphid development rate decreased cycle amplitude, while the increase in parasitoid attack rate increased cycle amplitude. There were also striking interactions among demographic rates. For example, the temperature-dependent increase in aphid development rate could either increase or decrease the cycle period depending on the values of other demographic rates. Although these complexities make predictions difficult, overall they suggest that increasing long-term mean temperature will decrease the period, increase the amplitude, and tend to destabilize pea aphid–A. ervi dynamics.},

While much is known about the direct effect that temperature can have on aquatic communities, less is known about its indirect effect via the temperature dependence of viscosity and temperature-dependent trophic interactions. 2. We manipulated the temperature (5–20 °C) and the viscosity (equivalent to 5–20 °C) of water in laboratory-based bacteria–protist communities. Communities contained food chains with one, two or three trophic levels. Responses measured were population dynamics (consumer carrying capacity and growth rate, average species population density, and the coefficient of variation of population density through time) and ecosystem function (decomposition). 3. Temperature, viscosity and food chain length produced significant responses in population dynamics. Temperature-dependent viscosity had a significant effect on the carrying capacity and growth rates of consumers, as well as the average density of the top predator. Overall, indirect effects of temperature via changes in viscosity were subtle in comparison to the indirect effect of temperature via trophic interactions. 4. Our results highlight the importance of direct and indirect effects of temperature, mediated through trophic interactions and physical changes in the environment, both for population dynamics and ecosystem processes. Future mechanistic modelling of effects of environmental change on species will benefit from distinguishing the different mechanisms of the overall effect of temperature.},

    abstract         = {Dynamics of complex systems is often driven by large and intricate networks of microscopic interactions, whose sheer size obfuscates understanding. With limited experimental data, many parameters of such dynamics are unknown, and thus detailed, mechanistic models risk overfitting and making faulty predictions. At the other extreme, simple ad hoc models often miss defining features of the underlying systems. Here we develop an approach that instead constructs phenomenological, coarse-grained models of network dynamics that automatically adapt their complexity to the available data. Such adaptive models produce accurate predictions even when microscopic details are unknown. The approach is computationally tractable, even for a relatively large number of dynamical variables. Using simulated data, it correctly infers the phase space structure for planetary motion, avoids overfitting in a biological signalling system and produces accurate predictions for yeast glycolysis with tens of data points and over half of the interacting species unobserved.},

    abstract         = {Recurrence is a fundamental property of dynamical systems, which can be exploited to characterise the system's behaviour in phase space. A powerful tool for their visualisation and analysis called recurrence plot was introduced in the late 1980's. This report is a comprehensive overview covering recurrence based methods and their applications with an emphasis on recent developments. After a brief outline of the theory of recurrences, the basic idea of the recurrence plot with its variations is presented. This includes the quantification of recurrence plots, like the recurrence quantification analysis, which is highly effective to detect, e.g., transitions in the dynamics of systems from time series. A main point is how to link recurrences to dynamical invariants and unstable periodic orbits. This and further evidence suggest that recurrences contain all relevant information about a system's behaviour. As the respective phase spaces of two systems change due to coupling, recurrence plots allow studying and quantifying their interaction. This fact also provides us with a sensitive tool for the study of synchronisation of complex systems. In the last part of the report several applications of recurrence plots in economy, physiology, neuroscience, earth sciences, astrophysics and engineering are shown. The aim of this work is to provide the readers with the know how for the application of recurrence plot based methods in their own field of research. We therefore detail the analysis of data and indicate possible difficulties and pitfalls.},

While there exist various information approaches for non-causal estimations of the functional connectome, approaches that characterize the causal functional connectivity - the causal relationships between neuronal time series, are scarce. In this work, we develop the Neuro-PC algorithm which is a novel methodology for inferring the causal functional connectivity between neurons from multi-dimensional time series, such as neuronal recordings. The core of our methodology relies on a novel adaptation of the PC algorithm, a state-of-the-art method for statistical causal inference, to the multi-dimensional time-series of neural dynamics. We validate the performance of the method on network motifs with various interactions between their neurons simulated using continuous-time artificial network of neurons. We then consider the application of the method to obtain the causal functional connectome for recent multi-array electrophysiological recordings from the mouse visual cortex in the presence of different stimuli. We show how features of the mapping can be used for quantification of the similarities between neural responses subject to different stimuli.},

For low feedback levels, we derive a third-order delay-differential equation for the phase of the laser field. We then show analytically and numerically that this equation admits coexisting branches of stable periodic solutions that appear at different and almost constant amplitudes. These amplitudes are proportional to the roots of the Bessel function J1(x). The bifurcation diagram of the phase equation is in good agreement with the numerical bifurcation diagram of the original Lang and Kobayashi equations. We interpret the onset of the periodic solutions as the emergence of a new set of external cavity modes with a more complicated time dependence. © 1996 The American Physical Society.},

                        How is it that groups of neurons dispersed through the brain interact to generate complex behaviors? Three papers in this issue present brain-scale studies of neuronal activity and dynamics (see the Perspective by Huk and Hart). Allen et al. found that in thirsty mice, there is widespread neural activity related to stimuli that elicit licking and drinking. Individual neurons encoded task-specific responses, but every brain area contained neurons with different types of response. Optogenetic stimulation of thirst-sensing neurons in one area of the brain reinstated drinking and neuronal activity across the brain that previously signaled thirst. Gründemann et al. investigated the activity of mouse basal amygdala neurons in relation to behavior during different tasks. Two ensembles of neurons showed orthogonal activity during exploratory and nonexploratory behaviors, possibly reflecting different levels of anxiety experienced in these areas. Stringer et al. analyzed spontaneous neuronal firing, finding that neurons in the primary visual cortex encoded both visual information and motor activity related to facial movements. The variability of neuronal responses to visual stimuli in the primary visual area is mainly related to arousal and reflects the encoding of latent behavioral states.

                        Structured Abstract
                        INTRODUCTIONIn the absence of sensory inputs, the brain produces structured patterns of activity, which can be as large as or larger than sensory-driven activity. Ongoing activity exists even in primary sensory cortices and has been hypothesized to reflect recapitulation of previous sensory experiences, or expectations of possible sensory events. Alternatively, ongoing activity could be related to behavioral and cognitive states.
                        RATIONALEMuch previous work has linked spontaneous neural activity to behavior through one-dimensional measures like running speed and pupil diameter. However, mice perform diverse behaviors consisting of whisking, licking, sniffing, and other facial movements. We hypothesized that there exists a multidimensional representation of behavior in visual cortex and that previously reported “noise” during stimulus presentations may in fact be behaviorally driven. To investigate this, we recorded the activity of {\textasciitilde}10,000 neurons in visual cortex of awake mice using two-photon calcium imaging, while simultaneously monitoring the facial movements using an infrared camera. In a second set of experiments, we recorded the activity of thousands of neurons across the brain using eight simultaneous Neuropixels probes, again videographically monitoring facial behavior.
                        RESULTSFirst, we found that ongoing activity in visual cortex is high dimensional: More than a hundred latent dimensions could be reliably extracted from the population activity. We found that a third of this activity could be predicted by a multidimensional model of the mouse’s behavior, extracted from the face video. This behaviorally related activity was not limited to visual cortex. We observed multidimensional representations of behavior in electrophysiological recordings from frontal, sensorimotor, and retrosplenial cortex; hippocampus; striatum; thalamus; and midbrain. Even though both behavior and neural activity contained fast–time scale fluctuations on the order of 200 ms, they were only related to each other at a time scale of about 1 s. We next investigated how this spontaneous, behavior-related signal interacts with stimulus responses. The representation of sensory stimuli and behavioral variables was mixed in the same neurons: The fractions of each neuron’s variance explained by stimuli and by behavior were only slightly negatively correlated, and neurons with similar stimulus responses did not have more similar behavioral correlates. Nevertheless, at a population level, the neural dimensions encoding motor variables overlapped with those encoding visual stimuli along only one dimension, which coherently increased or decreased the activity of the entire population. Activity in all other behaviorally driven dimensions continued unperturbed regardless of sensory stimulation.
                        CONCLUSIONThe brainwide representation of behavioral variables suggests that information encoded nearly anywhere in the forebrain is combined with behavioral state variables into a mixed representation. We found that these multidimensional signals are present both during ongoing activity and during passive viewing of a stimulus. This suggests that previously reported noise during stimulus presentations may consist primarily of behavioral-state information. What benefit could this ubiquitous mixing of sensory and motor information provide? The most appropriate behavior for an animal to perform at any moment depends on the combination of available sensory data, ongoing motor actions, and purely internal variables such as motivational drives. Integration of sensory inputs with motor actions must therefore occur somewhere in the nervous system. Our data indicate that it happens as early as primary sensory cortex. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/364/6437/eaav7893/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Large-scale neural population recordings can be predicted from behavior.We used new recording technologies to simultaneously monitor the activity of {\textasciitilde}10,000 neurons in a single brain area and {\textasciitilde}3000 neurons from across the brain (top left). These neurons showed slow–time scale patterns of coactivation restricted to subsets of neurons which were distributed across the brain (top right). The patterns of neural activity appeared to be driven by specific spontaneous behaviors that the animals engaged in during the experiment. We tracked these spontaneous behaviors by projecting a video recording of the mouse face onto a set of canonical “eigenfaces” (bottom left) and used these projections to predict a large fraction of the neural activity (bottom right). t, time; PC, principal component.
                        Neuronal populations in sensory cortex produce variable responses to sensory stimuli and exhibit intricate spontaneous activity even without external sensory input. Cortical variability and spontaneous activity have been variously proposed to represent random noise, recall of prior experience, or encoding of ongoing behavioral and cognitive variables. Recording more than 10,000 neurons in mouse visual cortex, we observed that spontaneous activity reliably encoded a high-dimensional latent state, which was partially related to the mouse’s ongoing behavior and was represented not just in visual cortex but also across the forebrain. Sensory inputs did not interrupt this ongoing signal but added onto it a representation of external stimuli in orthogonal dimensions. Thus, visual cortical population activity, despite its apparently noisy structure, reliably encodes an orthogonal fusion of sensory and multidimensional behavioral information.
                        Neurons in the primary visual cortex encode both visual information and motor activity.

The potentials and limits of this test procedure are established by its application to different types of numerically generated time series ranging from simple linear stochastic processes to high-dimensional transient chaos as well as to observational data from geophysics and physiology. Problems of practical implementation are discussed, in particular the relation between the lengths of the time series and its maximal relevant time scales. Furthermore, artifacts and counterexamples are presented.},

Comorbidities of DM, such as macrovascular and microvascular changes, also interact with DPN and affect its course. In patients with DM, DPN is the leading cause of foot ulcers, which in turn are a major cause of amputation in the United States. Although most patients with DPN do not have pain, approximately 11% of patients with DPN have chronic, painful symptoms that diminish quality of life, disrupt sleep, and can lead to depression. Despite the number of patients affected by DPN pain, little consensus exists about the pathophysiology, best diagnostic tools, and primary treatment choices. This article reviews the current knowledge about and presents recommendations for diagnostic assessment of DPN pain based on a review of the literature.},

    abstract         = {Neuropathic pain remains underrecognised and ineffectively treated in chronic pain sufferers. Consequently, their quality of life is considerably reduced, and substantial healthcare costs are incurred. The anatomical location of pain must be identified for definitive diagnosis, but current neuropsychological tools cannot do so. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) are thought to maintain peripheral neuroinflammation, and MMP-12 is elevated particularly in such pathological conditions. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the peripheral nervous system has made headway, owing to its high-contrast resolution and multiplanar features. We sought to improve MRI specificity of neural lesions, by constructing an MMP-12-targeted magnetic iron oxide nanoparticle (IONP). Its <italic>in vivo</italic> efficiency was evaluated in a rodent model of neuropathic pain, where the left lumbar 5 (L5) spinal nerve was tightly ligated. Spinal nerve ligation (SNL) successfully induced mechanical allodynia, and thermal hyperalgesia, in the left hind paw throughout the study duration. These neuropathy characteristics were absent in animals that underwent sham surgery. MMP-12 upregulation with concomitant macrophage infiltration, demyelination, and elastin fibre loss was observed at the site of ligation. This was not observed in spinal nerves contralateral and ipsilateral to the ligated spinal nerve or uninjured left L5 spinal nerves. The synthesised MMP-12-targeted magnetic IONP was stable and nontoxic <italic>in vitro</italic>. It was administered onto the left L5 spinal nerve by intrathecal injection, and decreased magnetic resonance (MR) signal was observed at the site of ligation. Histology analysis confirmed the presence of iron in ligated spinal nerves, whereas iron was not detected in uninjured left L5 spinal nerves. Therefore, MMP-12 is a potential biomarker of neuropathic pain. Its detection <italic>in vivo</italic>, using IONP-enhanced MRI, may be further developed as a tool for neuropathic pain diagnosis and management.},

    abstract         = {Summary Central post-stroke pain (CPSP) is a neuropathic pain syndrome characterized by constant or intermittent pain in a body part occurring after stroke and associated with sensory abnormalities in the painful body part. This study describes CPSP prospectively during the first year after stroke and characterizes the cerebrovascular lesions and neurological signs associated with the CPSP syndrome. Two hundred and sixty-seven consecutively admitted patients younger than 81 years were examined in the first week, at 1, 6 and 12 months after stroke. Sensibility to touch (cotton wool), temperature (20°C and 40°C), and pinprick was studied using the contralateral face and extremity as control. A CT scan was done 8 (median) days (range: 1-34 days) after stroke. Two hundred and seven (78%) patients surviving at least 6 months who were able to communicate reliably formed the basis of the study. Abnormal sensory signs were found at least once in 87 (42%) patients. CPSP was found in 16 (8%) patients of whom all but 1 patient also had evoked dysesthesia or allodynia. Further 1 patient had persistent evoked dysesthesia but denied pain. CPSP was not related to sex or age. In patients with single acute cerebral lesions there were no relation between size or location of the lesions and the presence of CPSP. The pain was light in 6 (3%) patients and moderate to severe in 10 (5%) patients. The pain quality was usually lacerating or aching. Fifteen (94%) patients had decreased temperature, touch and pain sensibility and 9 (56%) reported allodynia to cold stimulation and another 9 (56%) patients reported this to touch. Pain onset was within 1 month after stroke in 10 (63%) patients, between 1 and 6 months in 3 (19%) patients and more than 6 months after stroke in 3 (19%) patients. ∗Corresponding author: Dr. Grethe Andersen, Dept. of Neurology, Aalborg Hospital, P.O.

    abstract         = {Mouse genetics has contributed significantly to our understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying tissue and nerve injury-induced persistent pain. To create a highly reproducible, relatively noninvasive model of neuropathic pain in the mouse, we examined the behavioral consequences of sparing each of the 3 distal branches of the sciatic nerve in wild-type mice after a model originally described in the rat. Sparing the tibial branch but sparing neither of the other branches produced robust mechanical allodynia while leaving heat sensibility intact. To assess the topographic organization of the IB4 population of afferents from each branch and to compare anatomic consistency across injury models, we examined loss of thiamine monophosphatase staining in the superficial dorsal horn after peripheral nerve injury. We found that each of the sciatic branches targets a distinct mediolateral location in inner lamina II and that each of the spared nerve injury models produced a more reproducible pattern of thiamine monophosphatase staining loss than did partial tight ligation. These results improve on previous nerve injury models in mouse, demonstrate similar behavioral changes as in rat, and provide novel information on the topographic organization of small diameter peripheral afferents in the mouse spinal cord.},

For instance, a renewed interest in the development of prostheses or neural interfaces was driven by the availability of novel nanomaterials that enabled the fabrication of implantable bioelectronics interfaces with reduced side effects and increased integration with the target biological tissue. The peculiar physical-chemical properties of nanomaterials have also contributed to the engineering of novel imaging devices toward sophisticated experimental settings, to smart fabricated scaffolds and microelectrodes, or other tools ultimately aimed at a better understanding of neural tissue functions. In this review, we focus on nanomaterials and specifically on carbon-based nanomaterials, such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene. While these materials raise potential safety concerns, they represent a tremendous technological opportunity for the restoration of neuronal functions. We then describe nanotools such as nanowires and nano-modified MEA for high-performance electrophysiological recording and stimulation of neuronal electrical activity. We finally focus on the fabrication of three-dimensional synthetic nanostructures, used as substrates to interface biological cells and tissues in vitro and in vivo.},

CQDs show excellent physical and chemical properties like high crystallization, good dispersibility, photoluminescence properties. In particular, the small size, superconductivity, and rapid electron transfer of CQDs endow the CQDs-based composite with improved electric conductivity and catalytic activity. Besides, CQDs have abundant functional groups on the surface which could facilitate the preparation of multi-component electrical active catalysts. The interactions inside these multi-component catalysts may further enhance the catalytic performance by promoting charge transfer which plays an important role in electrochemistry. Most recent researches on CQDs have focused on their fluorescence characteristics and photocatalytic properties. This review will summarize the primary advances of CQDs in the synthetic methods, excellent physical and electronic properties, and application in electrocatalysis, including oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reduction (HER), and CO<sub>2</sub> reduction reaction (CO<sub>2</sub>RR).},

Apart from the Scotch tap legend, the massive production of graphene is important for graphene research and applications. The current preparation methods can be classified into top-down (eg, chemical intercalation and liquid exfoliation) and bottom-up (eg, chemical vapor deposition and, chemical total synthesis) strategies. The massive production of graphene has enabled researchers to explore graphene in a variety of applications, for instance, energy conversion and storage, sensor, reinforcement, catalysis, separation, and so on. Meanwhile, inspired by the legend of graphene, other layered materials are being investigated. Challenges and future perspectives in the studies of graphene and other quasi-two-dimensional nanomaterials are discussed.},

    abstract         = {Nanocarbons can be characterized by their curvature—that is, positively curved fullerenes, zero-curved graphene, and negatively curved schwarzites. Schwartzites are fascinating materials but have not been synthesized yet, although disordered materials with local properties similar to schwarzites (“random schwarzites”) have been isolated. A promising synthetic method allows for the interior surfaces of zeolites to be templated with sp2 carbon, but theoretical study of these zeolite-templated carbons (ZTCs) has been limited because of their noncrystalline structures. In this work, we develop an improved molecular description of ZTCs, show that they are equivalent to schwartzites, and thus make the experimental discovery of schwarzites ex post facto. Our topological characterization of ZTCs lends insights into how template choice allows for the tunability of ordered microporous carbons.Zeolite-templated carbons (ZTCs) comprise a relatively recent material class synthesized via the chemical vapor deposition of a carbon-containing precursor on a zeolite template, followed by the removal of the template. We have developed a theoretical framework to generate a ZTC model from any given zeolite structure, which we show can successfully predict the structure of known ZTCs. We use our method to generate a library of ZTCs from all known zeolites, to establish criteria for which zeolites can produce experimentally accessible ZTCs, and to identify over 10 ZTCs that have never before been synthesized. We show that ZTCs partition space into two disjoint labyrinths that can be described by a pair of interpenetrating nets. Since such a pair of nets also describes a triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS), our results establish the relationship between ZTCs and schwarzites—carbon materials with negative Gaussian curvature that resemble TPMSs—linking the research topics and demonstrating that schwarzites should no longer be thought of as purely hypothetical materials.},

Yet eye and head movements bring about frequent changes in the retinal image, and it is less clear that exposure to brief presentations will produce similar desensitization. To address this, we made extracellular recordings from single neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus of anesthetized marmosets, a New World primate. We measured the contrast response for drifting gratings before and after 0.5-s exposure to a high-contrast drifting grating, a stationary grating, or a blank screen. Prior exposure to the drifting grating reduced the contrast sensitivity of cells in the magnocellular pathway, on average by 23%; this reduction remained strong when the adapting and test stimuli were separated by 0.4 s. Exposure to a stationary grating of the preferred spatial phase did not change the contrast response; exposure to the opposite spatial phase did. None of the brief adaptors reduced the sensitivity of parvocellular cells. We conclude that brief periods of high contrast, such as those that would be expected to occur during a normal visual fixation, are sufficient to reduce the sensitivity of magnocellular-pathway cells.},

Crauel and Flandoli       (J. Dynam.

Indeed, we show that in this example the dynamics before       and after the underlying deterministic bifurcation point are       topologically equivalent. However, in apparent paradox to (J. Dynam.       Differential Equations 10 (1998) 259-274), we show that there is after      all a qualitative change in the random dynamics at the underlying       deterministic bifurcation point, characterized by the transition from       a hyperbolic to a non-hyperbolic dichotomy spectrum. This breakdown       manifests itself also in the loss of uniform attractivity, a loss of       experimental observability of the Lyapunov exponent, and a loss of       equivalence under uniformly continuous topological conjugacies.},

A detailed nonlinear dynamical model of a generator along with its excitation control and turbine governing system loop and motor loads have been considered. The hard limiters in the generator control loops have been modelled using a new approach in an analytic form and its load torque as nonlinear function of speed. The analyses have been carried out on two sample systems one consisting of a single and the other containing multiple generators.},

    abstract         = {In the Earth's history, periods of relatively stable climate have often been interrupted by sharp transitions to a contrasting state. One explanation for such events of abrupt change is that they happened when the earth system reached a critical tipping point. However, this remains hard to prove for events in the remote past, and it is even more difficult to predict if and when we might reach a tipping point for abrupt climate change in the future. Here, we analyze eight ancient abrupt climate shifts and show that they were all preceded by a characteristic slowing down of the fluctuations starting well before the actual shift. Such slowing down, measured as increased autocorrelation, can be mathematically shown to be a hallmark of tipping points. Therefore, our results imply independent empirical evidence for the idea that past abrupt shifts were associated with the passing of critical thresholds. Because the mechanism causing slowing down is fundamentally inherent to tipping points, it follows that our way to detect slowing down might be used as a universal early warning signal for upcoming catastrophic change. Because tipping points in ecosystems and other complex systems are notoriously hard to predict in other ways, this is a promising perspective.},

Theoretical interpretations considering the brain as a dynamical system suggest that prior to a seizure, recorded brain signals may exhibit critical slowing down, a warning signal preceding many critical transitions in dynamical systems. Using long-term intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings from fourteen patients with focal epilepsy, we monitored key signatures of critical slowing down prior to seizures. The metrics used to detect critical slowing down fluctuated over temporally long scales (hours to days), longer than would be detectable in standard clinical evaluation settings. Seizure risk was associated with a combination of these signals together with epileptiform discharges. These results provide strong validation of theoretical models and demonstrate that critical slowing down is a reliable indicator that could be used in seizure forecasting algorithms.},

The next era of brain mapping will be driven by studies that consider both of these components of brain organization simultaneously--elucidating their interactions and dependencies. Using this guiding principle, we explored the origin of slowly fluctuating patterns of synchronization within the topological core of brain regions known as the rich club, implicated in the regulation of mood and introspection. We find that a constellation of densely interconnected regions that constitute the rich club (including the anterior insula, amygdala and precuneus) play a central role in promoting a stable, dynamical core of spontaneous activity in the primate cortex. The slow timescales are well matched to the regulation of internal visceral states, corresponding to the somatic correlates of mood and anxiety. In contrast, the topology of the surrounding 'feeder' cortical regions shows unstable, rapidly fluctuating dynamics likely to be crucial for fast perceptual processes. We discuss these findings in relation to psychiatric disorders and the future of connectomics.},

This observation is at the core of the so-called criticality hypothesis, which states that systems in a dynamical regime between order and disorder attain the highest level of computational capabilities and achieve an optimal trade-off between robustness and flexibility. Recent results in cellular and evolutionary biology, neuroscience and computer science have revitalised the interest in the criticality hypothesis, emphasising its role as a viable candidate general law in adaptive complex systems. This paper provides an overview of the works on dynamical criticality that are -- To the best of our knowledge -- Particularly relevant for the criticality hypothesis. The authors review the main contributions concerning dynamics and information processing at the edge of chaos, and illustrate the main achievements in the study of critical dynamics in biological systems. Finally, the authors discuss open questions and propose an agenda for future work.},

The MRI data acquired by the HCP differ in many ways from data acquired on conventional 3 Tesla scanners and often require newly developed preprocessing methods. We describe the minimal preprocessing pipelines for structural, functional, and diffusion MRI that were developed by the HCP to accomplish many low level tasks, including spatial artifact/distortion removal, surface generation, cross-modal registration, and alignment to standard space. These pipelines are specially designed to capitalize on the high quality data offered by the HCP. The final standard space makes use of a recently introduced CIFTI file format and the associated grayordinate spatial coordinate system. This allows for combined cortical surface and subcortical volume analyses while reducing the storage and processing requirements for high spatial and temporal resolution data. Here, we provide the minimum image acquisition requirements for the HCP minimal preprocessing pipelines and additional advice for investigators interested in replicating the HCP's acquisition protocols or using these pipelines. Finally, we discuss some potential future improvements to the pipelines.},

Using a dataset of 40 MRI scans we manually identified 34 cortical ROIs in each of the individual hemispheres. This information was then encoded in the form of an atlas that was utilized to automatically label ROIs. To examine the validity, as well as the intra- and inter-rater reliability of the automated system, we used both intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), and a new method known as mean distance maps, to assess the degree of mismatch between the manual and the automated sets of ROIs. When compared with the manual ROIs, the automated ROIs were highly accurate, with an average ICC of 0.835 across all of the ROIs, and a mean distance error of less than 1 mm. Intra- and inter-rater comparisons yielded little to no difference between the sets of ROIs. These findings suggest that the automated method we have developed for subdividing the human cerebral cortex into standard gyral-based neuroanatomical regions is both anatomically valid and reliable. This method may be useful for both morphometric and functional studies of the cerebral cortex as well as for clinical investigations aimed at tracking the evolution of disease-induced changes over time, including clinical trials in which MRI-based measures are used to examine response to treatment.},

Recent studies indicate that people can predict motion onset before it occurs, raising the question of what informational cues underlie this ability. We use data from an antagonistic game between two participants, an Attacker and a Blocker wherein the Blocker is asked to parry the movements of the Attacker. We find that well before the Attacker starts to move, the fluctuations of the Attacker’s body about a static pose are accompanied by early warning signals akin to critical transitions in dynamical systems. These early warning signals allow for the anticipation of the Attacker’s impending motion before it occurs. Analysis of the early warning signals allows us to characterize the nature of the critical transition, and to simulate it in a simple dot motion experiment. When the dot motion simulations are shown to human participants, we find that they react faster if there is a coming critical transition relative to a transition devoid of the early warning signals. This suggests that people recognize and act upon early warning signals when inferring the onset of motion, and more generally in motor decision making processes.},

However, whether abnormalities at the cellular level can be diagnosed from network activity measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is largely unknown, yet of high clinical relevance. Here a putative mechanism reported in neurodevelopmental disorders, that is, excitation-to-inhibition ratio (E:I), was chemogenetically increased within cortical microcircuits of the mouse brain and measured via fMRI. Increased E:I caused a significant “reduction” of long-range connectivity, irrespective of whether excitatory neurons were facilitated or inhibitory Parvalbumin (PV) interneurons were suppressed. Training a classifier on fMRI signals, we were able to accurately classify cortical areas exhibiting increased E:I. This classifier was validated in an independent cohort of Fmr1y/− knockout mice, a model for autism with well-documented loss of parvalbumin neurons and chronic alterations of E:I. Our findings demonstrate a promising novel approach towards inferring microcircuit abnormalities from macroscopic fMRI measurements.},

Here, we investigate how top-down input causes frequency changes in slow oscillations during sensory processing and, in turn, how the slow oscillations are combined with fast oscillations (which encode sensory input). Using experimental connectivity patterns and strengths of interneurons, we develop a system-level model of a neuronal circuit controlling these oscillatory behaviors, allowing us to understand the mechanisms responsible for the observed oscillatory behaviors. Our analysis discovers a circuit capable of producing the observed oscillatory behaviors and finds that a detailed balance in the strength of synaptic connections is the critical determinant to produce such oscillatory behaviors. We not only uncover how disparate frequency bands are modulated and combined but also give insights into the causes of abnormal neuronal activities present in brain disorders.},

Dependent on the stage, these activities can be spontaneous uncorrelated events or rhythmic oscillations generated by transient or nascent neuronal networks.Cortical interneuron activity is important for the differentiation of subtype-specific attributes such as layer settling position, morphology, synaptic specificity and molecular markers.Key aspects of interneuron development are dependent on activity-dependent mechanisms including distinct calcium signalling pathways and associated activity-mediated gene expression.Although it is now clear that activity supports the specification of cortical interneurons, the precise balance between developmental predisposition and environmental specialization remains unclear. The rapid expansion and use of new molecular techniques promise to soon provide us with a more complete understanding of how interneuron fate is specified. It will also clarify the link between crucial developmental periods and the plasticity within brain circuits required for learning and memory.},

    abstract         = {Technological advances over the last decade are changing the face of behavioral neuroscience research. Here we review recent work on the use of one such transformative tool in behavioral neuroscience research, chemogenetics (or Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs, DREADDS). As transformative technologies such as DREADDs are introduced, applied, and refined, their utility in addressing complex questions about behavior and cognition becomes clear and exciting. In the behavioral neuroscience field, remarkable new findings now regularly appear as a result of the ability to monitor and intervene in neural processes with high anatomical precision as animals behave in complex task environments. As these new tools are applied to behavioral questions, individualized procedures for their use find their way into diverse labs. Thus, "tips of the trade" become important for wide dissemination not only for laboratories that are using the tools but also for those who are interested in incorporating them into their own work. Our aim is to provide an up-to-date perspective on how the DREADD technique is being used for research on learning and memory, decision making, and goal-directed behavior, as well as to provide suggestions and considerations for current and future users based on our collective experience.

    abstract         = {Excitation-inhibition (E:I) imbalance is theorized as an important pathophysiological mechanism in autism. Autism affects males more frequently than females and sex-related mechanisms (e.g., X-linked genes, androgen hormones) can influence E:I balance. This suggests that E:I imbalance may affect autism differently in males versus females. With a combination of in-silico modeling and in-vivo chemogenetic manipulations in mice, we first show that a time-series metric estimated from fMRI BOLD signal, the Hurst exponent (H), can be an index for underlying change in the synaptic E:I ratio. In autism we find that H is reduced, indicating increased excitation, in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) of autistic males but not females. Increasingly intact MPFC H is also associated with heightened ability to behaviorally camouflage social-communicative difficulties, but only in autistic females. This work suggests that H in BOLD can index synaptic E:I ratio and that E:I imbalance affects autistic males and females differently.},

Subsequent screening in human cell lines facilitated the creation of a family of muscarinic acetylcholine GPCRs suitable for in vitro and in situ studies. We subsequently created lines of telomerase-immortalized human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells stably expressing all five family members and found that each one faithfully recapitulated the signaling phenotype of the parent receptor. We also expressed a Gi-coupled designer receptor in hippocampal neurons (hM4D) and demonstrated its ability to induce membrane hyperpolarization and neuronal silencing. We have thus devised a facile approach for designing families of GPCRs with engineered ligand specificities. Such reverse-engineered GPCRs will prove to be powerful tools for selectively modulating signal-transduction pathways in vitro and in vivo.},

Coherent control of nuclear spin dynamics is a powerful tool for the experimental implementation of quantum schemes in liquid and solid nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) system, especially in liquid-state NMR. Compared with other quantum information processing systems, the NMR platform has the advantages such as the long coherence time, the precise manipulation, and well-developed quantum control techniques, which make it possible to accurately control a quantum system with up to 12-qubits. Extensive applications of liquid-state NMR spectroscopy in quantum information processing such as quantum communication, quantum computing, and quantum simulation have been thoroughly studied over half a century. This article introduces the general principles of NMR quantum information processing, and reviews the new-developed techniques. The review will also include the recent achievements of the experimental realization of quantum algorithms for machine learning, quantum simulations for high energy physics, and topological order in NMR. We also discuss the limitation and prospect of liquid-state NMR spectroscopy and the solid-state NMR systems as quantum computing in the article.},

As a chloride-selective channel, it mediates rapid synaptic inhibition in mammalian spinal cord, brainstem, higher brain centres and nonneuronal tissues. In recent years, our understanding of glycine receptors has steadily grown, adding considerable depth to our knowledge of receptor function, structure, cellular trafficking and tissue distribution. Furthermore, new roles for glycinergic transmission in higher brain function have been uncovered. Glycine receptors should no longer be considered only as mediators of spinal reflexes, but were also found to play an important role in the modulation of higher brain function, including vision, hearing and pain signalling. The identification of novel agonists and modulators underlines the relevance of the inhibitory glycine receptor as a therapeutic target. This review extends a previous article of this series and highlights key developments in glycine receptor research over the past 2–3 years. Key Concepts: Glycine receptors are key mediators of rapid synaptic inhibition in mammalian spinal cord and higher brain centres. Glycine receptors are members of the cys-loop family of ligand-gated ion channel receptors. Glycinergic signalling is involved in motor control, pain signalling, vision, hearing and other brain functions. Mutations in glycine receptor genes underlie human hyperekplexia and related myoclonic diseases. New modulators of glycine receptor function are rare and of considerable medicinal interest.},

    abstract         = {Epilepsy, one of the most prevalent neurological conditions, presents as a complex disorder of network homeostasis characterized by spontaneous non-provoked seizures and associated comorbidities. Currently used antiepileptic drugs have been designed to suppress neuronal hyperexcitability and thereby to suppress epileptic seizures. However, the current armamentarium of antiepileptic drugs is not effective in over 30% of patients, does not affect the comorbidities of epilepsy, and does not prevent the development and progression of epilepsy (epileptogenesis). Prevention of epilepsy and its progression remains the Holy Grail for epilepsy research and therapy development, requiring novel conceptual advances to find a solution to this urgent medical need. The methylation hypothesis of epileptogenesis suggests that changes in DNA methylation are implicated in the progression of the disease. In particular, global DNA hypermethylation appears to be associated with chronic epilepsy. Clinical as well as experimental evidence demonstrates that epilepsy and its progression can be prevented by biochemical manipulations and those that target previously unrecognized epigenetic functions contributing to epilepsy development and maintenance of the epileptic state. This mini-review will discuss, epigenetic mechanisms implicated in epileptogenesis and biochemical interactions between adenosine and glycine as a conceptual advance to understand the contribution of maladaptive changes in biochemistry as a major contributing factor to the development of epilepsy. New findings based on biochemical manipulation of the DNA methylome suggest that: (i) epigenetic mechanisms play a functional role in epileptogenesis; and (ii) therapeutic reconstruction of the epigenome is an effective antiepileptogenic therapy.},

Although reinforcement of adaptive social interactions is ostensibly required for the evolutionary persistence of these behaviours, the neural mechanisms by which social reward is encoded by the brain are largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that in mice oxytocin acts as a social reinforcement signal within the nucleus accumbens core, where it elicits a presynaptically expressed long-term depression of excitatory synaptic transmission in medium spiny neurons. Although the nucleus accumbens receives oxytocin-receptor-containing inputs from several brain regions, genetic deletion of these receptors specifically from dorsal raphe nucleus, which provides serotonergic (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) innervation to the nucleus accumbens, abolishes the reinforcing properties of social interaction. Furthermore, oxytocin-induced synaptic plasticity requires activation of nucleus accumbens 5-HT1B receptors, the blockade of which prevents social reward. These results demonstrate that the rewarding properties of social interaction in mice require the coordinated activity of oxytocin and 5-HT in the nucleus accumbens, a mechanistic insight with implications for understanding the pathogenesis of social dysfunction in neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism.},

    abstract         = {Neurons in the insular cortex are activated by acute and chronic pain, and inhibition of neuronal activity in the insular cortex has analgesic effects. We found that in a mouse model in which peripheral nerve injury leads to the development of neuropathic pain, the insular cortex showed changes in synaptic plasticity, which were associated with a long-term increase in the amount of synaptic N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), but not that of extrasynaptic NMDARs. Activation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent signaling enhanced the amount of synaptic NMDARs in acutely isolated insular cortical slices and increased the surface localization of NMDARs in cultured cortical neurons. We found that the increase in the amount of NMDARs required phosphorylation of the NMDAR subunit GluN2B at Tyr1472 by a pathway involving adenylyl cyclase subtype 1 (AC1), protein kinase A (PKA), and Src family kinases. Finally, injecting NMDAR or GluN2B-specific antagonists into the insular cortex reduced behavioral responses to normally nonnoxious stimuli in the mouse model of neuropathic pain. Our results suggest that activity-dependent plasticity takes place in the insular cortex after nerve injury and that inhibiting the increase in NMDAR function may help to prevent or treat neuropathic pain.},

    year             = {2012},
    abstract         = {Larger mammalian cerebral cortices tend to have increasingly folded surfaces, often considered to result from the lateral expansion of the gray matter (GM), which, in a volume constrained by the cranium, causes mechanical compression that is relieved by inward folding of the white matter (WM), or to result from differential expansion of cortical layers. Across species, thinner cortices, presumably more pliable, would offer less resistance and hence become more folded than thicker cortices of a same size. However, such models do not acknowledge evidence in favor of a tension-based pull onto the GM from the inside, holding it in place even when the constraint imposed by the cranium is removed. Here we propose a testable, quantitative model of cortical folding driven by tension along the length of axons in the WM that assumes that connections through the WM are formed early in development, at the same time as the GM becomes folded, and considers that axonal connections through the WM generate tension that leads to inward folding of the WM surface, which pulls the GM surface inward. As an important necessary simplifying hypothesis, we assume that axons leaving or entering the WM do so approximately perpendicularly to the WM–GM interface. Cortical folding is thus driven by WM connectivity, and is a function of the fraction of cortical neurons connected through the WM, the average length, and the average cross-sectional area of the axons in the WM. Our model predicts that the different scaling of cortical folding across mammalian orders corresponds to different combinations of scaling of connectivity, axonal cross-sectional area, and tension along WM axons, instead of being a simple function of the number of GM neurons. Our model also explains variations in average cortical thickness as a result of the factors that lead to cortical folding, rather than as a determinant of folding; predicts that for a same tension, folding increases with connectivity through the WM and increased axonal cross-section; and that, for a same number of neurons, higher connectivity through the WM leads to a higher degree of folding as well as an on average thinner GM across species.},

The great variety of living mammals exhibit a corresponding variety of brain shapes, sizes, and patterns of fissuration and convolution of the cerebral neocortex.

    abstract         = {During human brain development, the cerebral cortex undergoes substantial folding, leading to its characteristic highly convoluted form. Folding is necessary to accommodate the expansion of the cerebral cortex; abnormal cortical folding is linked to various neurological disorders, including schizophrenia, epilepsy, autism, and mental retardation. Although this process requires mechanical forces, the specific force-generating mechanisms that drive folding remain unclear. The two most widely accepted hypotheses are as follows: (1) Folding is caused by differential growth of the cortex and (2) folding is caused by mechanical tension generated in axons. Direct evidence supporting either theory, however, is lacking. Here we show that axons are indeed under considerable tension in the developing ferret brain, but the patterns of tissue stress are not consistent with a causal role for axonal tension. In particular, microdissection assays reveal that significant tension exists along axons aligned circumferentially in subcortical white matter tracts, as well as those aligned radially inside developing gyri (outward folds). Contrary to previous speculation, however, axonal tension is not directed across developing gyri, suggesting that axon tension does not drive folding. On the other hand, using computational (finite element) models, we show that differential cortical growth accompanied by remodeling of the subplate leads to outward folds and stress fields that are consistent with our microdissection experiments, supporting a mechanism involving differential growth. Local perturbations, such as temporal differences in the initiation of cortical growth, can ensure consistent folding patterns. This study shows that a combination of experimental and computational mechanics can be used to evaluate competing hypotheses of morphogenesis, and illuminate the biomechanics of cortical folding.},

    abstract         = {BACKGROUND: Recent studies have revealed the antinociceptive effects of glycine transporter (GlyT) inhibitors in neuropathic pain models such as sciatic nerve-injured and diabetic animals. Bone cancer can cause the most severe pain according to complex mechanisms in which a neuropathic element is included. Bone cancer modifies the analgesic action of opioids and limits their effectiveness, and thus novel medicament for bone cancer pain is desired. METHODS: For the femur bone cancer model, NCTC 2472 tumor cells were injected into the medullary cavity of the distal femur of C3H/HeN mice. Effects of GlyT2 inhibitors, ORG 25543 and ALX 1393, and GlyT1 inhibitors, ORG 25935, and knockdown of the expression of spinal GlyTs protein by GlyTs siRNA on pain-like behaviors, such as allodynia, withdrawal threshold, guarding behavior, and limb-use abnormality, were examined in the femur bone cancer model mice. Effects of morphine in combination with GlyT inhibitor were examined. RESULTS: GlyT2 inhibitors, ORG 25543 and ALX 1393, and GlyT1 inhibitor ORG 25935 by IV or oral administration or knockdown of the expression of spinal GlyTs protein improved pain-like behaviors at 11 days after tumor transplantation. The pain-relief activity was potent and long lasting. Morphine at a dose with no analgesic activity combined with ORG 25543 further promoted the ORG 25543-induced pain-relief activity. Injection of ORG 25543 on the second day after tumor implantation caused 3 phases of pain responses; pain-like behaviors were initially accelerated (at 2-4 days) and subsequently almost disappeared (5-7 days) and then reappeared. Intrathecal injection of strychnine 1 day after injection of ORG 25543 transiently antagonized the pain-relief activity of ORG 25543. In control mice, strychnine improved pain-like behaviors 4 days after tumor implantation and aggravated the behaviors between 4 and 5 days. The evidence suggests that the different mechanisms are phase-dependently involved. CONCLUSIONS: GlyT inhibitors with or without morphine may be a new strategy for the treatment of bone cancer pain and lead to further investigations of the mechanisms underlying the development of bone cancer pain.},

This study provides a systematic examination of F-test robustness to violations of normality in terms of Type I error, considering a wide variety of distributions commonly found in the health and social sciences. METHOD: We conducted a Monte Carlo simulation study involving a design with three groups and several known and unknown distributions. The manipulated variables were: Equal and unequal group sample sizes; group sample size and total sample size; coefficient of sample size variation; shape of the distribution and equal or unequal shapes of the group distributions; and pairing of group size with the degree of contamination in the distribution. RESULTS: The results showed that in terms of Type I error the F-test was robust in 100% of the cases studied, independently of the manipulated conditions.},

    abstract           = {The approach to patients with acute pain begins by identifying the underlying cause and a disease-specific treatment. The first-line pharmacologic agent for the symptomatic treatment of mild to moderate pain is acetaminophen or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). The choice between these two medications depends on the type of pain and patient risk factors for NSAID-related adverse effects (e.g., gastrointestinal, renovascular, or cardiovascular effects). Different NSAIDs have similar analgesic effects. However, cyclooxygenase-2 selective NSAIDs (e.g., celecoxib) must be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular risk factors and are more expensive than nonselective NSAIDs. If these first-line agents are not sufficient for mild to moderate pain, medications that target separate pathways simultaneously, such as an acetaminophen/opioid combination, are reasonable choices. Severe acute pain is typically treated with potent opioids. At each step, adjuvant medications directed at the underlying condition can be used. Newer medications with dual actions (e.g., tapentadol) are also an option. There is little evidence that one opioid is superior for pain control, but there are some pharmacologic differences among opioids. Because of the growing misuse and diversion of controlled substances, caution should be used when prescribing opioids, even for short-term treatment. Patients should be advised to properly dispose of unused medications.},

Nanocarriers can utilize different physiological mechanisms for drug delivery across the BBB and can be modified to achieve the desired kinetics and efficacy. Consequentially, several nanocarriers have been reported to act as functional nanomedicines in preclinical studies using animal models for human diseases. Given the rapid development of novel nanocarriers, this review provides a comprehensive insight into the most recent advancements made in nanocarrier-based drug delivery to the CNS, such as the development of multifunctional nanomedicines and theranostics.},

Establishing a causal link between circuit dysfunction and particular behavioral traits that are relevant to schizophrenia is crucial to shed new light on the mechanisms underlying the pathology. We studied an animal model of the human 22q11 deletion syndrome, the mutation that represents the highest genetic risk of developing schizophrenia. We observed a desynchronization of hippocampal neuronal assemblies that resulted from parvalbumin interneuron hypoexcitability. Rescuing parvalbumin interneuron excitability with pharmacological or chemogenetic approaches was sufficient to restore wild-type-like CA1 network dynamics and hippocampal-dependent behavior during adulthood. In conclusion, our data provide insights into the network dysfunction underlying schizophrenia and highlight the use of reverse engineering to restore physiological and behavioral phenotypes in an animal model of neurodevelopmental disorder.},

The development of new tools and technology has allowed investigators to classify many diverse groups of inhibitory neurons by several delineating factors: these include their connectivity motifs, expression of specific molecular markers, receptor diversity, and ultimately their role in brain function. Despite this progress, however, there is still limited understanding of how GABAergic neurons are recruited by their input and how their activity is modulated by behavioral states. This limitation is primarily due to the fact that studies of GABAergic inhibition are mainly geared toward determining how, once activated, inhibitory circuits regulate the activity of excitatory neurons. In this review article, we will outline recent work investigating the anatomical and physiological properties of inputs that activate cortical GABAergic neurons, and discuss how these inhibitory cells are differentially recruited during behavior.},

The calcium-binding proteins (CBPs) calbindin (CB), calretinin (CR), and parvalbumin (PV) are used as markers of specific subpopulations of cortical GABAergic interneurons. We examined the postmortem prefrontal cortical region (Brodmann's area 9) of patients with SCZ and BPD, and of age-matched control subjects, excluding suicide cases. The laminar density of neurons immunoreactive (IR) for three CBPs, namely CB, CR, and PV, was quantified. The densities of CB-IR neurons in layer 2 and PV-IR neurons in layer 4 in the SCZ subjects decreased compared with those in the control subjects. When CBP-IR neurons were classified according to their size, a reduction in the density of medium CB-IR neurons in layer 2 in SCZ subjects and an increase in the density of large CR-IR neurons in layer 2 in BPD subjects were observed. These results suggest that alterations in specific GABAergic neurons are present in mental disorders, and that such alterations may reflect the vulnerability toward the disorders.},

Consistent with this notion, excitation-inhibition imbalances are considered a pathophysiological mechanism in many brain disorders including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, methods to measure E/I ratios in human brain networks are lacking. Here, we present a method to quantify a functional E/I ratio (fE/I) from neuronal oscillations, and validate it in healthy subjects and children with ASD. We define structural E/I ratio in an in silico neuronal network, investigate how it relates to power and long-range temporal correlations (LRTC) of the network’s activity, and use these relationships to design the fE/I algorithm. Application of this algorithm to the EEGs of healthy adults showed that fE/I is balanced at the population level and is decreased through GABAergic enforcement. In children with ASD, we observed larger fE/I variability and stronger LRTC compared to typically developing children (TDC). Interestingly, visual grading for EEG abnormalities that are thought to reflect E/I imbalances revealed elevated fE/I and LRTC in ASD children with normal EEG compared to TDC or ASD with abnormal EEG. We speculate that our approach will help understand physiological heterogeneity also in other brain disorders.},

In animal models of FXS and of ASD, GABA-B agonists have improved both brain and behavioral phenotypes, including social behavior. A phase 2 randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial found that the GABA-B agonist arbaclofen improved social avoidance symptoms in FXS. A pilot open-label trial of arbaclofen suggested similar benefits in ASD. We therefore evaluated arbaclofen in a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2 study of 150 participants, aged 5-21 years, with ASD. No difference from placebo was detected on the primary outcome measure, the parent-rated Aberrant Behavior Checklist Social Withdrawal/Lethargy subscale. However, a specified secondary analysis found improvement on the clinician-rated Clinical Global Impression of Severity. An exploratory post hoc analysis of participants with a consistent rater across the trial revealed greater improvement in the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales II socialization domain in participants receiving arbaclofen. Affect lability (11%) and sedation (9%) were the most common adverse events. In this exploratory study, secondary analyses suggest that arbaclofen may have the potential to improve symptoms in some children with ASD, but further study will be needed to replicate and extend these initial findings.},

Widely used methods typically rank genes according to their differential expressions among phenotypes and pick the top-ranked genes. We observe that feature sets so obtained have certain redundancy and study methods to minimize it. We propose a minimum redundancy - maximum relevance (MRMR) feature selection framework. Genes selected via MRMR provide a more balanced coverage of the space and capture broader characteristics of phenotypes. They lead to significantly improved class predictions in extensive experiments on 6 gene expression data sets: NCI, Lymphoma, Lung, Child Leukemia, Leukemia, and Colon. Improvements are observed consistently among 4 classification methods: Naive Bayes, Linear discriminant analysis, Logistic regression, and Support vector machines.

    abstract         = {A single stressful event can cause morphologic and functional changes in neurons and even malfunction of vascular systems, which can lead to acute stress disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder. However, there is a lack of evidence regarding how acute stress impacts neuronal activity, the concurrent vascular response, and the relationship between these two factors, which is defined as neurovascular coupling. Here, using in vivo two-photon imaging, we found that NMDA-evoked calcium transients of excitatory neurons were impaired and that vasodilation of penetrating arterioles was concomitantly disrupted in acutely stressed male mice. Furthermore, acute stress altered the relationship between excitatory neuronal calcium coherence and vascular responses. By measuring NMDA-evoked excitatory and inhibitory neuronal calcium activity in acute brain slices, we confirmed that neuronal coherence both between excitatory neurons and between excitatory and inhibitory neurons was reduced by acute stress but restored by blockade of glucocorticoid receptor signaling. Furthermore, the ratio of sEPSCs to sIPSCs was altered by acute stress, suggesting that the excitation-inhibition balance was disrupted by acute stress. In summary, in vivo, ex vivo, and whole-cell recording studies demonstrate that acute stress modifies excitatory-inhibitory neuronal coherence, disrupts the excitation-inhibition balance, and causes consequent neurovascular coupling changes, providing critical insights into the neural mechanism of stress-induced disorders.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Acute stress can cause pathologic conditions, such as acute stress disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder, by affecting the functions of neurons and blood vessels. However, investigations into the impacts of acute stress on neurovascular coupling, the tight connection between local neural activity and subsequent blood flow changes, are lacking. Through investigations at the in vivo, ex vivo, and whole-cell recording levels, we found that acute stress alters the NMDA-evoked vascular response, impairs the function and coherence of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, and disrupts the excitatory and inhibitory balance. These novel findings provide insights into the relevance of the excitatory-inhibitory balance, neuronal coherence, and neurovascular coupling to stress-induced disorders.},

    abstract         = {Neurovascular coupling (NVC), the interaction between neural activity and vascular response, ensures normal brain function by maintaining brain homeostasis. We previously reported altered cerebrovascular responses during functional hyperemia in chronically stressed animals. However, the underlying neuronal-level changes associated with those hemodynamic changes remained unclear. Here, using in vivo and ex vivo experiments, we investigate the neuronal origins of altered NVC dynamics under chronic stress conditions in adult male mice. Stimulus-evoked hemodynamic and neural responses, especially beta and gamma-band local field potential activity, were significantly lower in chronically stressed animals, and the NVC relationship, itself, had changed. Further, using acute brain slices, we discovered that the underlying cause of this change was dysfunction of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS)-mediated vascular responses. Using FISH to check the mRNA expression of several GABAergic subtypes, we confirmed that only nNOS mRNA was significantly decreased in chronically stressed mice. Ultimately, chronic stress impairs NVC by diminishing nNOS-mediated vasodilation responses to local neural activity. Overall, these findings provide useful information in understanding NVC dynamics in the healthy brain. More importantly, this study reveals that impaired nNOS-mediated NVC function may be a contributory factor in the progression of stress-related diseases.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The correlation between neuronal activity and cerebral vascular dynamics is defined as neurovascular coupling (NVC), which plays an important role for meeting the metabolic demands of the brain. However, the impact of chronic stress, which is a contributory factor of many cerebrovascular diseases, on NVC is poorly understood. We therefore investigated the effects of chronic stress on impaired neurovascular response to sensory stimulation and their underlying mechanisms. Multimodal approaches, from in vivo hemodynamic imaging and electrophysiology to ex vivo vascular imaging with pharmacological treatment, patch-clamp recording, FISH, and immunohistochemistry revealed that chronic stress-induced dysfunction of nNOS-expressing interneurons contributes to NVC impairment. These findings will provide useful information to understand the role of nNOS interneurons in NVC in normal and pathological conditions.},

    abstract         = {Functional neuroimaging has provided evidence for altered function of mesolimbic circuits implicated in reward processing, first and foremost the ventral striatum, in patients with schizophrenia. While such findings based on significant group differences in brain activations can provide important insights into the pathomechanisms of mental disorders, the use of neuroimaging results from standard univariate statistical analysis for individual diagnosis has proven difficult. In this proof of concept study, we tested whether the predictive accuracy for the diagnostic classification of schizophrenia patients vs. healthy controls could be improved using multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) of regional functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activation patterns for the anticipation of monetary reward. With a searchlight MVPA approach using support vector machine classification, we found that the diagnostic category could be predicted from local activation patterns in frontal, temporal, occipital and midbrain regions, with a maximal cluster peak classification accuracy of 93% for the right pallidum. Region-of-interest based MVPA for the ventral striatum achieved a maximal cluster peak accuracy of 88%, whereas the classification accuracy on the basis of standard univariate analysis reached only 75%. Moreover, using support vector regression we could additionally predict the severity of negative symptoms from ventral striatal activation patterns. These results show that MVPA can be used to substantially increase the accuracy of diagnostic classification on the basis of task-related fMRI signal patterns in a regionally specific way.},

Hence, it is especially suitable for large-scale applications where data structures need to be distributed over the network.

    abstract         = {Electroweak baryogenesis (EWBG) remains a theoretically attractive and experimentally testable scenario for explaining the cosmic baryon asymmetry. We review recent progress in computations of the baryon asymmetry within this framework and discuss their phenomenological consequences. We pay particular attention to methods for analyzing the electroweak phase transition and calculating CP-violating asymmetries, the development of Standard Model extensions that may provide the necessary ingredients for EWBG, and searches for corresponding signatures at the high energy, intensity and cosmological frontiers.},

The study of equilibrium phase transitions presented in this book involves a combination of modeling, mathematical analysis, and physical predictions. First, the standard model for a thermodynamic system is derived using the recently discovered potential-descending principle (PDP), addressed in Chap. 7. Second, all equilibrium phase transitions are fully characterized by three basic theorems. Third, the dynamical law of fluctuations is derived, and we show that the standard model, together with the dynamic law of fluctuation, offers correct information for critical exponents. Fourth, the theory is applied to gas-liquid transitions, ferromagnetism, binary systems, superconductivity, and liquid heliums, leading to various physical predictions and insights to the underlying physical problems.},

A potential solution may lie in a unique aspect of neurobiology, which is that numerous brain systems contain diffuse synaptic connectivity. Here, we demonstrate that increasing diffuse cortical coupling within a validated biophysical corticothalamic model traverses the system through a quasi-critical regime in which spatial heterogeneities in input noise support transient critical dynamics in distributed subregions. The presence of quasi-critical states coincides with known signatures of complex, adaptive brain network dynamics. Finally, we demonstrate the presence of similar dynamic signatures in empirical whole-brain human neuroimaging data. Together, our results establish that modulating the balance between local and diffuse synaptic coupling in a thalamocortical model subtends the emergence of quasi-critical brain states that act to flexibly transition the brain between unique modes of information processing.},

Here we investigated the spatial, dynamic, and molecular signatures of system-wide neural activity across a range of cognitive tasks. We found that neuronal activity converged onto a low-dimensional manifold that facilitates the execution of diverse task states. Flow within this attractor space was associated with dissociable cognitive functions, unique patterns of network-level topology, and individual differences in fluid intelligence. The axes of the low-dimensional neurocognitive architecture aligned with regional differences in the density of neuromodulatory receptors, which in turn relate to distinct signatures of network controllability estimated from the structural connectome. These results advance our understanding of functional brain organization by emphasizing the interface between neural activity, neuromodulatory systems, and cognitive function.},

This specialization of function is thought to be underpinned by corresponding changes in the brain{\textquoteright}s local circuitry. Here we combine a wide range of measurements across the mouse brain, including the expression of genes, cell densities, and axonal connectivity, to show that the properties of local circuits of the mouse brain vary along putative processing streams in a similar way to the primate brain. This similarity across species points to common mechanisms through which mammalian brains may process information.The primate cerebral cortex displays a hierarchy that extends from primary sensorimotor to association areas, supporting increasingly integrated function underpinned by a gradient of heterogeneity in the brain{\textquoteright}s microcircuits. The extent to which these hierarchical gradients are unique to primate or may reflect a conserved mammalian principle of brain organization remains unknown. Here we report the topographic similarity of large-scale gradients in cytoarchitecture, gene expression, interneuron cell densities, and long-range axonal connectivity, which vary from primary sensory to prefrontal areas of mouse cortex, highlighting an underappreciated spatial dimension of mouse cortical specialization. Using the T1-weighted:T2-weighted (T1w:T2w) magnetic resonance imaging map as a common spatial reference for comparison across species, we report interspecies agreement in a range of large-scale cortical gradients, including a significant correspondence between gene transcriptional maps in mouse cortex with their human orthologs in human cortex, as well as notable interspecies differences. Our results support the view of systematic structural variation across cortical areas as a core organizational principle that may underlie hierarchical specialization in mammalian brains.},

We used empirical time series from five freshwater ecosystems with documented sudden, persistent transitions hypothesized to represent critical transitions. EWIs were detected in several of these long-term records, and in some cases several years before the transition; however, these EWIs varied in reliability, and agreement between indicators was low. Moreover, their applicability was strongly limited by the requirement for ecosystem-specific knowledge of transition-generating mechanisms and their drivers to choose relevant state variables for analysis.Ecosystems can show sudden and persistent changes in state despite only incremental changes in drivers. Such critical transitions are difficult to predict, because the state of the system often shows little change before the transition. Early-warning indicators (EWIs) are hypothesized to signal the loss of system resilience and have been shown to precede critical transitions in theoretical models, paleo-climate time series, and in laboratory as well as whole lake experiments. The generalizability of EWIs for detecting critical transitions in empirical time series of natural aquatic ecosystems remains largely untested, however. Here we assessed four commonly used EWIs on long-term datasets of five freshwater ecosystems that have experienced sudden, persistent transitions and for which the relevant ecological mechanisms and drivers are well understood. These case studies were categorized by three mechanisms that can generate critical transitions between alternative states: competition, trophic cascade, and intraguild predation. Although EWIs could be detected in most of the case studies, agreement among the four indicators was low. In some cases, EWIs were detected considerably ahead of the transition. Nonetheless, our results show that at present, EWIs do not provide reliable and consistent signals of impending critical transitions despite using some of the best routinely monitored freshwater ecosystems. Our analysis strongly suggests that a priori knowledge of the underlying mechanisms driving ecosystem transitions is necessary to identify relevant state variables for successfully monitoring EWIs.},

    abstract         = {Many complex systems exhibit critical transitions. Of considerable interest are bifurcations, small smooth changes in underlying drivers that produce abrupt shifts in system state. Before reaching the bifurcation point, the system gradually loses stability (‘critical slowing down’). Signals of critical slowing down may be detected through measurement of summary statistics, but how extrinsic and intrinsic noises influence statistical patterns prior to a transition is unclear. Here, we consider a range of stochastic models that exhibit transcritical, saddle-node and pitchfork bifurcations. Noise was assumed to be either intrinsic or extrinsic. We derived expressions for the stationary variance, autocorrelation and power spectrum for all cases. Trends in summary statistics signaling the approach of each bifurcation depend on the form of noise. For example, models with intrinsic stochasticity may predict an increase in or a decline in variance as the bifurcation parameter changes, whereas models with extrinsic noise applied additively predict an increase in variance. The ability to classify trends of summary statistics for a broad class of models enhances our understanding of how critical slowing down manifests in complex systems approaching a transition.},

Representing the rules and the neuronal selectivity as vectors in the space spanned by a set of stimulus features allowed us to characterize neuronal dynamics in geometrical terms. We found that neurons in the cingulate cortex mainly rotated toward the rule, implying a policy search, whereas neurons in the putamen showed a magnitude increase that followed the rotation of cortical neurons, implying strengthening of confidence for the newly acquired rule-based policy. Further, the neural representation at the end of a session predicted next-day behavior, reflecting overnight retention. The novel framework for characterization of neural dynamics suggests complementing roles for the putamen and the anterior cingulate cortex.},

    abstract         = {Many phenomena, both natural and human influenced, give rise to signals whose statistical properties change under time translation, i.e., are nonstationary. For some practical purposes, a nonstationary time series can be seen as a concatenation of stationary segments. However, the exact segmentation of a nonstationary time series is a hard computational problem which cannot be solved exactly by existing methods. For this reason, heuristic methods have been proposed. Using one such method, it has been reported that for several cases of interest—e.g., heart beat data and Internet traffic fluctuations—the distribution of durations of these stationary segments decays with a power-law tail. A potential technical difficulty that has not been thoroughly investigated is that a nonstationary time series with a (scalefree) power-law distribution of stationary segments is harder to segment than other nonstationary time series because of the wider range of possible segment lengths. Here, we investigate the validity of a heuristic segmentation algorithm recently proposed by Bernaola-Galván et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 87, 168105 (2001)] by systematically analyzing surrogate time series with different statistical properties. We find that if a given nonstationary time series has stationary periods whose length is distributed as a power law, the algorithm can split the time series into a set of stationary segments with the correct statistical properties. We also find that the estimated power-law exponent of the distribution of stationary-segment lengths is affected by (i) the minimum segment length and (ii) the ratio R≡σε/σ¯x, where σ¯x is the standard deviation of the mean values of the segments and σε is the standard deviation of the fluctuations within a segment. Furthermore, we determine that the performance of the algorithm is generally not affected by uncorrelated noise spikes or by weak long-range temporal correlations of the fluctuations within segments.},

Here we explore some properties of both natural and horizontal visibility graphs associated to several nonstationary processes, and we pay particular attention to their capacity to assess time irreversibility. Nonstationary signals are (infinitely) irreversible by definition (independently of whether the process is Markovian or producing entropy at a positive rate), and thus the link between entropy production and time series irreversibility has only been explored in nonequilibrium stationary states. Here we show that the visibility formalism naturally induces a new working definition of time irreversibility, which allows us to quantify several degrees of irreversibility for stationary and nonstationary series, yielding finite values that can be used to efficiently assess the presence of memory and off-equilibrium dynamics in nonstationary processes without the need to differentiate or detrend them. We provide rigorous results complemented by extensive numerical simulations on several classes of stochastic processes.},

We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for nonstationary signal classification in the space of model coefficients. Applying the empirical modeling technique to electroencephalogram (EEG) records analysis, we find evidence of high-dimensional nonlinear dynamics in quasistationary EEG segments. Reccurence analysis of model parameters reveals long-term correlations in nonstationary EEG records.

Such data are widespread, including, for example, intercorrelations of survey items, direct ratings on the similarity on choice objects, or trade indices for a set of countries. MDS represents the data as distances among points in a geometric space of low dimensionality. This map can help to see patterns in the data that are not obvious from the data matrices. MDS is also used as a psychological model for judgments of similarity and preference. This book may be used as an introduction to MDS for students in psychology, sociology, and marketing. The prerequisite is an elementary background in statistics. The book is also well suited for a variety of advanced courses on MDS topics. All the mathematics required for more advanced topics is developed systematically. This second edition is not only a complete overhaul of its predecessor, but also adds some 140 pages of new material. Many chapters are revised or have sections reflecting new insights and developments in MDS. There are two new chapters, one on asymmetric models and the other on unfolding. There are also numerous exercises that help the reader to practice what he or she has learned, and to delve deeper into the models and its intricacies. These exercises make it easier to use this edition in a course. All data sets used in the book can be downloaded from the web. The appendix on computer programs has also been updated and enlarged to reflect the state of the art. Ingwer Borg is Scientific Director at the Center for Survey Methodology (ZUMA) in Mannheim, Germany, and Professor of Psychology at the University of Giessen, Germany. He has authored or edited 14 books and numerous articles on data analysis, survey research, theory construction, and various substantive topics of psychology.

In this paper, we investigated the stationarity and linearity of resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) time series data from the Midnight Scan Club datasets. The degree of stationarity (DS) and degree of nonlinearity (DN) were respectively estimated for the time series of all gray matter voxels. The similarity and difference between the DS and DN were assessed in terms of voxels, and intrinsic brain networks including the visual network, somatomotor network, dorsal attention network, ventral attention, limbic network, frontoparietal network, and default mode network. The test-retest scans were utilized to quantify the reliability of DS and DN. We found that DS and DN maps had overlapping spatial distribution. Meanwhile, the probability density estimate function of DS had a long tail and that of DN had a more normal distribution. Specifically, stronger DS was present in the somatomotor, limbic and ventral attention networks compared to other networks, and stronger DN was found in the somatomotor, visual, limbic, ventral attention, and default mode networks. The percentage of overlapping voxels between DS and DN demonstrated a decreasing trend from default mode, ventral attention, somatomotor, frontoparietal, dorsal attention, visual, and limbic networks. Furthermore, the ICC values of DS were higher than those of DN. Our results suggest that different functional networks have distinct nonstationarity and nonlinear properties owing to the complexity of rs-fMRI time series. Thus, caution should be taken when analyzing fMRI data (both resting state and task activation) using simplified models.},

We discuss how to extract the two relevant well separated superstatistical time scales τ and T, the probability density of the superstatistical parameter β, and the correlation function for β from the experimental data. We illustrate our approach by applying it to velocity time series measured in turbulent Taylor-Couette flow, which is well described by log-normal superstatistics and exhibits clear time scale separation.},

    abstract         = {We study the well-known multiplicative log-normal cascade process in which the multiplication of Gaussian and log normally distributed random variables yields time series with intermittent bursts of activity. Due to the nonstationarity of this process and the combinatorial nature of such a formalism, its parameters have been estimated mostly by fitting the numerical approximation of the associated non-Gaussian probability density function to empirical data, cf. Castaing et al. [Physica D 46, 177 (1990)]. More recently, alternative estimators based upon various moments have been proposed by Beck [Physica D 193, 195 (2004)] and Kiyono et al. [Phys. Rev. E 76, 041113 (2007)]. In this paper, we pursue this moment-based approach further and develop a more rigorous generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation procedure to cope with the documented difficulties of previous methodologies. We show that even under uncertainty about the actual number of cascade steps, our methodology yields very reliable results for the estimated intermittency parameter. Employing the Levinson-Durbin algorithm for best linear forecasts, we also show that estimated parameters can be used for forecasting the evolution of the turbulent flow. We compare forecasting results from the GMM and Kiyono et al.'s procedure via Monte Carlo simulations. We finally test the applicability of our approach by estimating the intermittency parameter and forecasting of volatility for a sample of financial data from stock and foreign exchange markets.},

This volume presents the estimation of the unknown parameters in the corresponding continuous models based on continuous and discrete observations and examines extensively maximum likelihood, minimum contrast and Bayesian methods. Useful because of the current availability of high frequency data is the study of refined asymptotic properties of several estimators when the observation time length is large and the observation time interval is small. Also space time white noise driven models, useful for spatial data, and more sophisticated non-Markovian and non-semimartingale models like fractional diffusions that model the long memory phenomena are examined in this volume.},

By combining aspects of multidimensional scaling, group lasso, and latent variable models, a dimensionally sparse projection is found in which the originally nonstationary field exhibits stationarity. Following a comparison with existing methods in a simulated environment, dimension expansion is studied on a classic test-bed dataset historically used to study nonstationary models. Following this, we explore the use of dimension expansion in modeling air pollution in the United Kingdom, a process known to be strongly influenced by rural/urban effects, amongst others, which gives rise to a nonstationary field.},

Convenient state space representations of the periodic models are proposed to facilitate model identification, specification and exact maximum likelihood estimation of the periodic parameters. These formulations do not require a priori (seasonal) differencing of the time series. The time-varying state space representation is an attractive alternative to the time-invariant vector representation of periodic models which typically leads to a high dimensional state vector in monthly periodic time series models. A key development is our method for computing the variance–covariance matrix of the initial set of observations which is required for exact maximum likelihood estimation. The two classes of periodic models are illustrated for a monthly postwar US unemployment time series.},

We present a nonparametric method for detecting step-like features in noisy biological data sets. Our algorithm does not assume that the steps can be modeled as Heaviside functions or any particular parametric form. No assumptions about the noise source, such as whether the noise is Gaussian or colored, are made either. Instead, for detection of plateaus, the algorithm uses the novel method of analyzing a probability distribution function of the data values. The vast majority of previously published methods for step detection rely on statistical fitting of step functions with the flat segments linked by vertical segments. Our approach is intended for use on data which cannot be modelled as a series of step functions but applies to step functions as a special case. These type of data traces have, so far, been difficult to characterize effectively. We examine the performance of the algorithm through systematic simulation studies and illustrate the use of our algorithm to analyze single molecule DNA-protein micromanipulation experiments carried out by our laboratory. The simulation results and experimental validation suggest that our method is very robust, avoids overfitting, and functions effectively in the presence of noise sources characteristic of single molecule experiments. © 2015 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry},

For example, in exploration geosciences, noisy drill hole records need to be separated into stratigraphic zones, and in biophysics, jumps between molecular dwell states have to be extracted from noisy fluorescence microscopy signals. Many PWC denoising methods exist, including total variation regularization, mean shift clustering, stepwise jump placement, running medians, convex clustering shrinkage and bilateral filtering; conventional linear signal processing methods are fundamentally unsuited. This paper (part I, the first of two) shows that most of these methods are associated with a special case of a generalized functional, minimized to achieve PWC denoising. The minimizer can be obtained by diverse solver algorithms, including stepwise jump placement, convex programming, finite differences, iterated running medians, least angle regression, regularization path following and coordinate descent. In the second paper, part II, we introduce novel PWC denoising methods, and comparisons between these methods performed on synthetic and real signals, showing that the new understanding of the problem gained in part I leads to new methods that have a useful role to play.},

The proposed model is based on the time-frequency representation of a process, which is essential for capturing the nonstationary characteristics of earthquake ground motions. Stationary wavelet transform is first utilized to decompose a sample of a multicomponent nonstationary random process into a set of monocomponent signals. These signals are subsequently transformed to analytic signals using the Hilbert transform, which yields the instantaneous amplitudes and frequencies. Without the customary assumption of piecewise stationarity or reliance on an assumed modulation function, this approach is able to simulate nonstationary random processes, such as earthquake ground motion, based on a sample realization of the process and its instantaneous features. The method is extended to the simulation of multivariate random processes utilizing the proper orthogonal decomposition. Example simulations of measured ground-motion records are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed scheme. Utilization of this method for simulation of gust fronts is also discussed, further emphasizing the utility of this new framework for the simulation of a host of nonstationary processes with their respective features.},

    abstract         = {This paper presents a rigorous derivation of a previously known formula for simulation of one-dimensional, univariate, nonstationary stochastic processes integrating Priestly’s evolutionary spectral representation theory. Applying this formula, sample functions can be generated with great computational efficiency. The simulated stochastic process is asymptotically Gaussian as the number of terms tends to infinity. This paper shows that (1) these sample functions accurately reflect the prescribed probabilistic characteristics of the stochastic process when the number of terms in the cosine series is large, i.e., the ensemble averaged evolutionary power spectral density function (PSDF) or autocorrelation function approaches the corresponding target function as the sample size increases, and (2) the simulation formula, under certain conditions, can be reduced to that for nonstationary white noise process or Shinozuka’s spectral representation of stationary process. In addition to derivation of simulation formula, three methods are developed in this paper to estimate the evolutionary PSDF of a given time-history data by means of the short-time Fourier transform (STFT), the wavelet transform (WT), and the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT). A comparison of the PSDF of the well-known El Centro earthquake record estimated by these methods shows that the STFT and the WT give similar results, whereas the HHT gives more concentrated energy at certain frequencies. Effectiveness of the proposed simulation formula for nonstationary sample functions is demonstrated by simulating time histories from the estimated evolutionary PSDFs. Mean acceleration spectrum obtained by averaging the spectra of generated time histories are then presented and compared with the target spectrum to demonstrate the usefulness of this method.},

The reduced series can then be resimulated in the frequency or time domain. The present series is resimulated in the frequency domain via a target spectrum, the spectrum of the reduced series.

Inertial measurement units (IMU) measure acceleration and rotational velocity which makes them attractive devises for gait analysis. The aim of this study was to compare three different methods for step detection from IMU data from turkeys. This is an essential step for future feature extraction for the evaluation of turkey locomotion. Data from turkeys walking through a corridor with IMUs attached to each upper leg were annotated manually. We evaluated change point detection, local extrema approach, and gradient boosting machine in terms of step detection and precision of start and end point of the steps. All three methods were successful in step detection, but local extrema approach showed more false detections. In terms of precision of start and end point of steps, change point detection performed poorly due to significant irregular delay, while gradient boosting machine was most precise. For the allowed distance to the annotated steps of 0.2s, the precision of gradient boosting machine was 0.81 and the recall was 0.84, which is much better in comparison to the other two methods ({\textless}0.61). At an allowed distance of 1s performance of the three models was similar. Gradient boosting machine was identified as the most accurate for signal segmentation with final goal to extract information about turkey gait, however it requires an annotated training dataset.},

Experimental technique and data analysis have seen such dramatic progress that, by now, most fundamental properties of nonlinear dynamical systems have been observed in the laboratory. Great efforts are being made to exploit ideas from chaos theory wherever the data displays more structure than can be captured by traditional methods.

    abstract         = {Synchronous activity of cortical inhibitory interneurons expressing parvalbumin (PV) underlies expression of cortical gamma rhythms. Paradoxically, deficient PV inhibition is associated with increased broadband gamma power in the local field potential (LFP). Increased baseline broadband gamma is also a prominent characteristic in schizophrenia and a hallmark of network alterations induced by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists such as ketamine. Whether enhanced broadband gamma is a true rhythm, and if so, whether rhythmic PV inhibition is involved or not, is debated. Asynchronous and increased firing activities are thought to contribute to broadband power increases spanning the gamma band. Using male and female mice lacking NMDAR activity specifically in PV neurons to model deficient PV inhibition, we here show that neuronal activity with decreased synchronicity is associated with increased prefrontal broadband gamma power. Specifically, reduced spike time precision and spectral leakage of spiking activity due to higher firing rates (spike “contamination”) affect the broadband gamma band. Desynchronization was evident at multiple time scales, with reduced spike entrainment to the LFP, reduced cross-frequency coupling, and fragmentation of brain states. Local application of S(+)-ketamine in (control) mice with intact NMDAR activity in PV neurons triggered network desynchronization and enhanced broadband gamma power. However, our investigations suggest that disparate mechanisms underlie increased broadband gamma power caused by genetic alteration of PV interneurons and ketamine-induced power increases in broadband gamma. Our study confirms that enhanced broadband gamma power can arise from asynchronous activities and demonstrates that long-term deficiency of PV inhibition can be a contributor.
                        SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT
                        Brain oscillations are fundamental to the coordination of neuronal activity across neurons and structures. Gamma oscillations (30-80 Hz) have received particular attention through their association with perceptual and cognitive processes. Synchronous activity of inhibitory PV interneurons generates cortical gamma oscillation, but, paradoxically, PV neuron deficiency is associated with increases in gamma oscillations. We here reconcile this conundrum and show how deficient PV inhibition can lead to increased and asynchronous excitatory firing, contaminating the LFP and manifesting as increased gamma power. Thus, increased gamma power does not always reflect a genuine rhythm. Further, we show that ketamine-induced gamma increases are caused by separate network mechanisms.},

Particular emphasis is given to emerging research that facilitates wide comparison of feature-based representations that allow us to understand the properties of a time-series dataset that make it suited to a particular feature-based representation or analysis algorithm.

However, recurrence computation is highly expensive as the size of time series increases. Few, if any, previous approaches have been capable of quantifying the recurrence properties from a long-term time series, while which is often collected in the real-time monitoring of complex systems. This paper presents a novel multiscale framework to explore recurrence dynamics in complex systems and resolve computational issues for a large-scale dataset. As opposed to the traditional single-scale recurrence analysis, we characterize and quantify recurrence dynamics in multiple wavelet scales, which captures not only nonlinear but also nonstationary behaviors in a long-term time series. The proposed multiscale recurrence approach was utilized to identify heart failure subjects from the 24-h time series of heart rate variability (HRV). It was shown to identify the conditions of congestive heart failure with an average sensitivity of 92.1% and specificity of 94.7%. The proposed multiscale recurrence framework can be potentially extended to other nonlinear dynamic methods that are computationally expensive for large-scale datasets.},

However, difficulties associated with inference from time-series data about unknown parameters in these models have been a constraint on their application. We present a new method that makes maximum likelihood estimation feasible for partially-observed nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems (also known as state-space models) where this was not previously the case. The method is based on a sequence of filtering operations which are shown to converge to a maximum likelihood parameter estimate. We make use of recent advances in nonlinear filtering in the implementation of the algorithm. We apply the method to the study of cholera in Bangladesh. We construct confidence intervals, perform residual analysis, and apply other diagnostics. Our analysis, based upon a model capturing the intrinsic nonlinear dynamics of the system, reveals some effects overlooked by previous studies.},

Here we show that signals that are nonlinear, non-stationary, non-gaussian, and discontinuous can be described by expanding the probabilistic dependence of the future on the past around local models of their relationship. The predictors derived from this general framework have the form of the global combinations of local functions that are used in statistics2,3,4, machine learning5,6,7,8,9,10 and studies of nonlinear dynamics11,12. Our method offers forecasts of errors in prediction and model estimation, provides a transparent architecture with meaningful parameters, and has straightforward implementations for offline and online applications.

    abstract         = {Many real-life dynamical systems experience abrupt changes followed by almost stationary periods. In this paper, we consider streams of data exhibiting such abrupt behavior and investigate the problem of tracking their statistical properties in an online manner. Wedevise a tracking procedure where an estimator that is suitable for a stationary environment is combined together with an estimator suitable for a dynamic environment. The current estimate is based on the stationary estimator unless a statistically significant difference is observed between both estimators. The stationary estimate is deemed off track and a large update (jump) is given to get the stationary estimate back on track. We use the Stochastic Learning Weak Estimator (SLWE) as the dynamic estimator. The SLWE is known to be the state-of-the art solution to tracking the properties of non-stationary environments, due to its multiplicative update form. Therefore, the SLWE is a better choice to accompany a stationary estimator than the far more common sliding window based approach. A theoretically well founded statistical testing procedure is developed to detect a significant difference between the stationary and dynamical estimators. Although our procedure bears similarities to the event detection procedure suggested by Ross et al. (Pattern Recogn Lett, 33(2):191-198, 2012), it is rather well founded theoretically. First, Ross et al. ignore the uncertainty in the stationary estimator in the detection procedure. Second, the detection threshold is determined based on heuristics and therefore lacks a solid statistical foundation. Extensive simulation results, based on both synthetic and real-life data related to news topic classification, demonstrate that our estimation procedure is easy to tune and outperforms legacy works.},

As such, there is an urgent need to develop prognostic techniques for such complex systems operating in the real world. This review paper focuses on prognostic techniques that can be applied to rotating machinery operating under non-linear and non-stationary conditions. The general concept of these techniques, the pros and cons of applying these methods, as well as their applications in the research field are discussed.

    abstract         = {Information theory allows us to investigate information processing in neural systems in terms of information transfer, storage and modification. Especially the measure of information transfer, transfer entropy, has seen a dramatic surge of interest in neuroscience. Estimating transfer entropy from two processes requires the observation of multiple realizations of these processes to estimate associated probability density functions. To obtain these necessary observations, available estimators typically assume stationarity of processes to allow pooling of observations over time. This assumption however, is a major obstacle to the application of these estimators in neuroscience as observed processes are often non-stationary. As a solution, Gomez-Herrero and colleagues theoretically showed that the stationarity assumption may be avoided by estimating transfer entropy from an ensemble of realizations. Such an ensemble of realizations is often readily available in neuroscience experiments in the form of experimental trials. Thus, in this work we combine the ensemble method with a recently proposed transfer entropy estimator to make transfer entropy estimation applicable to non-stationary time series. We present an efficient implementation of the approach that is suitable for the increased computational demand of the ensemble method's practical application. In particular, we use a massively parallel implementation for a graphics processing unit to handle the computationally most heavy aspects of the ensemble method for transfer entropy estimation. We test the performance and robustness of our implementation on data from numerical simulations of stochastic processes. We also demonstrate the applicability of the ensemble method to magnetoencephalographic data. While we mainly evaluate the proposed method for neuroscience data, we expect it to be applicable in a variety of fields that are concerned with the analysis of information transfer in complex biological, social, and artificial systems.},

Following the context, the methods defined around the concept of Recurrence Plot Analysis (RPA) constitute an interesting way of analyzing non-stationary signals and, particularly, the transient ones. Starting from the phase space and the recurrence matrix, new approaches [the angular distance, recurrence-based autocorrelation function (ACF), average-magnitude difference function (AMDF) and time-distributed recurrence (TDR)] are introduced in order to extract information about the non-stationary signals, specific to different applications.

    abstract         = {Objective: Measures of transfer entropy (TE) quantify the direction and strength of coupling between two complex systems. Standard approaches assume stationarity of the observations, and therefore are unable to track time-varying changes in nonlinear information transfer with high temporal resolution. In this study, we aim to define and validate novel instantaneous measures of TE to provide an improved assessment of complex nonstationary cardiorespiratory interactions. Methods: We here propose a novel instantaneous point-process TE (ipTE) and validate its assessment as applied to cardiovascular and cardiorespiratory dynamics. In particular, heartbeat and respiratory dynamics are characterized through discrete time series, and modeled with probability density functions predicting the time of the next physiological event as a function of the past history. Likewise, nonstationary interactions between heartbeat and blood pressure dynamics are characterized as well. Furthermore, we propose a new measure of information transfer, the instantaneous point-process information transfer (ipInfTr), which is directly derived from point-process-based definitions of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance. Results and Conclusion: Analysis on synthetic data, as well as on experimental data gathered from healthy subjects undergoing postural changes confirms that ipTE, as well as ipInfTr measures are able to dynamically track changes in physiological systems coupling. Significance: This novel approach opens new avenues in the study of hidden, transient, nonstationary physiological states involving multivariate autonomic dynamics in cardiovascular health and disease. The proposed method can also be tailored for the study of complex multisystem physiology (e.g., brain-heart or, more in general, brain-body interactions).},

The recovery of these parameters is especially challenging as they are non-linearly related to the measured field. In order to do this we use an empirical Bayesian scheme to estimate the cortical current distribution due to a range of laterally shifted head-models. We compare different methods of approaching this problem from the division of M/EEG data into stationary sections and performing separate source inversions, to explaining all of the M/EEG data with a single inversion. We demonstrate this through estimation of head position in both simulated and empirical resting state MEG data collected using a head-cast.},

In this paper, we consider a simple model that mimics the evolution of the protection barriers to study the efficiency of the system's reaction to extreme events and how it changes our perception of the sequence of extreme events itself. We obtain that the usual method of fighting extreme events introduces a periodicity in their occurrence and is generally less efficient than the use of a constant barrier. On the other hand, it shows a good adaptation to the presence of slow non-stationarities.},

Direct observation of the step-like motion of these machines with time series from novel experimental assays has recently become possible. These time series are corrupted by molecular and experimental noise that requires removal, but classical signal processing is of limited use for recovering such step-like dynamics. This paper reports simple, novel Bayesian filters that are robust to step-like dynamics in noise, and introduce an L1-regularized, global filter whose sparse solution can be rapidly obtained by standard convex optimization methods. We show these techniques outperforming classical filters on simulated time series in terms of their ability to accurately recover the underlying step dynamics. To show the techniques in action, we extract step-like speed transitions from Rhodobacter sphaeroides flagellar motor time series.},

Typical types of behaviors of the parametrically excited double pendula are presented, including chaos, rotations and periodic oscillations, and the bifurcation analysis is performed, exhibiting complex transitions from one type of motion into another. The character of the observed dynamics is analyzed using Lyapunov exponents, which confirms the hyperchaotic nature of the system. Particular attention is paid to the transient behaviors, showing that the length of the irregular motion can be extremely sensitive to both parameters and initial conditions. Apart from the single double pendulum, we consider also the case of two coupled double pendula, connected by a typical linear scheme. Our results show that depending on the network’s parameters, one can observe the phenomenon of a transient chaotic synchronization, during which the units spontaneously synchronize and desynchronize. The loss of coherence is strictly related to the motion of the pendula around the unstable equilibrium of the system, which has been confirmed in the scenario of pure chaotic oscillations. We determine the regions of the occurrence of transient synchronization in the coupling parameters’ plane, as well as study the statistical properties of the observed patterns. We show that the problem of determining the final dynamical attractor of the system is not straightforward.},

Here{,} we present a highly active and stable CO2 methanation catalyst that is derived from a Ru-impregnated zirconium-based metal–organic framework (MOF) material. The Ru-doped MOF is transformed{,} under reaction conditions{,} into an active catalyst which yields CO2 conversions of 96% and a CH4 selectivity of 99%. We demonstrate that the final catalyst was composed of a mixture of Ru-nanoparticles supported on monoclinic and tetragonal ZrO2 nanoparticles. Notably{,} such catalytic activity has only been achieved using the MOF templating strategy. Catalysts of the same composition were synthesized via different methods but were less active for CO2 methanation.},

SR-based characterization methods can be employed to analyze different systems such as powders, thin films, and bulk forms having complex crystalline or amorphous structures. In this review, peculiarities of SR are briefly explained. Moreover, various techniques carried out utilizing this instrument for material characterization such as X-ray powder diffraction, grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction, small/wide-angle X-ray scattering, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, different techniques of X-ray imaging, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray microprobes/nanoprobes are presented. As a result, by shedding light on the advantages of SR and its superiority to the equivalent laboratory experiments, researchers are recommended to exploit the capabilities of this invaluable tool in their materials characterization.},

Typically, the extraction of relevant information from time series data relies on predefined, human-interpretable features. Without a priori knowledge of the system, the predefined features may fail to cover the entire spectrum of dynamics. Here we present CODEX, a data-driven approach based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that identifies patterns in time series. It does not require a priori information about the biological system and the insights into the data are built through explanations of the CNNs' predictions. CODEX provides several views of the data: visualization of all the single-cell trajectories in a low-dimensional space, identification of prototypic trajectories, and extraction of distinctive motifs. We demonstrate how CODEX can provide new insights into ERK and Akt signaling in response to various growth factors, and we recapitulate findings in p53 and TGF?-SMAD2 signaling.},

In the present paper, regarding the delay as parameter, we investigate the effect of delay on the dynamics of Chen's system with delayed feedback. We first consider the effect of delay on the steady states, and then investigate the existence of local Hopf bifurcations. By using the normal form theory and center manifold argument, we derive the explicit formulas determining the stability, direction and other properties of bifurcating periodic solutions. Finally, we give several numerical simulations, which indicate that when the delay passes through certain critical values, chaotic oscillation is converted into a stable steady state or a stable periodic orbit.},

The modified Ikeda system model is designed by introducing a superimposed tanh function term into the sine nonlinearity term. Stability and Hopf bifurcation characteristics of the system are analyzed theoretically. Numerical simulations, carried out in terms of bifurcation diagrams, Lyapunov exponents spectrum, phase portraits, and two-parameter (2D) largest Lyapunov exponent diagrams are employed to highlight the complex dynamical behaviors exhibited by the enhanced system. The results indicate that the modified system has rich dynamical behaviors including limit cycle, multiscroll hyperchaos, chaos, and hyperchaos. Moreover, as a major outcome of this paper, considering the fragile chaos phenomenon, the ACCM-Ikeda time delay system has better dynamical complexity and larger connected chaotic parameter spaces (connectedness means that there is no stripe corresponding to nonchaotic dynamics embedded in the chaos regions).},

In particular, it is enough to integrate just one perturbation to obtain two largest Lyapunov exponents, which enables to search for hyperchaos. Moreover, in the presented algorithm, only very basic mathematical operations such as summation, multiplication or division are applied, which boost the efficiency of computations. All these features together make the new method faster than any other known by the authors if the order of the system under consideration is low. Correctness the method has been tested for three examples: Lorenz system, Duffing oscillator and three Duffing oscillators coupled in the ring scheme. Moreover, efficiency of the method has been confirmed by two practical tests. It has been revealed that for low-order systems, the presented method is faster than any other known by authors.},

This work develops a novel framework to discover governing equations underlying a dynamical system simply from data measurements, leveraging advances in sparsity techniques and machine learning. The resulting models are parsimonious, balancing model complexity with descriptive ability while avoiding overfitting. There are many critical data-driven problems, such as understanding cognition from neural recordings, inferring climate patterns, determining stability of financial markets, predicting and suppressing the spread of disease, and controlling turbulence for greener transportation and energy. With abundant data and elusive laws, data-driven discovery of dynamics will continue to play an important role in these efforts.Extracting governing equations from data is a central challenge in many diverse areas of science and engineering. Data are abundant whereas models often remain elusive, as in climate science, neuroscience, ecology, finance, and epidemiology, to name only a few examples. In this work, we combine sparsity-promoting techniques and machine learning with nonlinear dynamical systems to discover governing equations from noisy measurement data. The only assumption about the structure of the model is that there are only a few important terms that govern the dynamics, so that the equations are sparse in the space of possible functions; this assumption holds for many physical systems in an appropriate basis. In particular, we use sparse regression to determine the fewest terms in the dynamic governing equations required to accurately represent the data. This results in parsimonious models that balance accuracy with model complexity to avoid overfitting. We demonstrate the algorithm on a wide range of problems, from simple canonical systems, including linear and nonlinear oscillators and the chaotic Lorenz system, to the fluid vortex shedding behind an obstacle. The fluid example illustrates the ability of this method to discover the underlying dynamics of a system that took experts in the community nearly 30 years to resolve. We also show that this method generalizes to parameterized systems and systems that are time-varying or have external forcing.},

    abstract         = {Principal component analysis is central to the study of multivariate data. Although one of the earliest multivariate techniques, it continues to be the subject of much research, ranging from new model-based approaches to algorithmic ideas from neural networks. It is extremely versatile, with applications in many disciplines. The first edition of this book was the first comprehensive text written solely on principal component analysis. The second edition updates and substantially expands the original version, and is once again the definitive text on the subject. It includes core material, current research and a wide range of applications. Its length is nearly double that of the first edition. Researchers in statistics, or in other fields that use principal component analysis, will find that the book gives an authoritative yet accessible account of the subject. It is also a valuable resource for graduate courses in multivariate analysis. The book requires some knowledge of matrix algebra. Ian Jolliffe is Professor of Statistics at the University of Aberdeen. He is author or co-author of over 60 research papers and three other books. His research interests are broad, but aspects of principal component analysis have fascinated him and kept him busy for over 30 years.},

But the benefit of curved components requires a careful control of the model complexity. Moreover, standard techniques for model selection, including cross-validation and more generally the use of an independent test set, fail when applied to nonlinear PCA because of its inherent unsupervised characteristics. This paper presents a new approach for validating the complexity of nonlinear PCA models by using the error in missing data estimation as a criterion for model selection. It is motivated by the idea that only the model of optimal complexity is able to predict missing values with the highest accuracy. While standard test set validation usually favours over-fitted nonlinear PCA models, the proposed model validation approach correctly selects the optimal model complexity.},

For a mechanical system, the sum of Lyapunov exponents is negative and related to the damping, and so can be utilised to monitor any changes of the damping mechanism. However, in order to track any changes the data segment used to compute the Lyapunov exponents must be short. This leads to problems since Lyapunov exponents are calculated from a long term averaged divergence rate. To overcome this problem, it is described how the sum of Instantaneous Lyapunov exponents is related to the generalised divergence of the flow and the damping of a mechanical system. Computer simulations using differential equations are implemented to demonstrate the significance of the sum of Instantaneous Lyapunov exponents. In practice, it may be difficult to obtain accurate Instantaneous Lyapunov exponents are introduced to overcome this. The sum of short term averaged Lyapunov exponents from a time series (from experimental data), and so short term averaged Lyapunov exponents is applied to experimental data to detect evolutionary changes in damping from high to low.},

    abstract         = {Assessment of causal influences is a ubiquitous and important subject across diverse research fields. Drawn from consciousness studies, integrated information is a measure that defines integration as the degree of causal influences among elements. Whereas pairwise causal influences between elements can be quantified with existing methods, quantifying multiple influences among many elements poses two major mathematical difficulties. First, overestimation occurs due to interdependence among influences if each influence is separately quantified in a part-based manner and then simply summed over. Second, it is difficult to isolate causal influences while avoiding noncausal confounding influences. To resolve these difficulties, we propose a theoretical framework based on information geometry for the quantification of multiple causal influences with a holistic approach. We derive a measure of integrated information, which is geometrically interpreted as the divergence between the actual probability distribution of a system and an approximated probability distribution where causal influences among elements are statistically disconnected. This framework provides intuitive geometric interpretations harmonizing various information theoretic measures in a unified manner, including mutual information, transfer entropy, stochastic interaction, and integrated information, each of which is characterized by how causal influences are disconnected. In addition to the mathematical assessment of consciousness, our framework should help to analyze causal relationships in complex systems in a complete and hierarchical manner.},

    abstract         = {This study addressed the issue of assessing chaotic parameters from nonstationary electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. The empirical mode decomposition (EMD) was proposed as a method to extract intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) from ECG signals. Chaos analysis methods were then applied to the stationary IMFs without violating the underlying assumption of stationarity. Eight ECG data sets representing normal and various abnormal rhythms were obtained from the American Heart Associate Ventricular Arrhythmia database. The chaotic parameters including Lyapunov exponent, entropy, and correlation dimension were computed. The results consistently showed that the 10th IMF (IMF-10) was stationary and preserved sufficient nonlinearity of the ECG signals. Each IMF-10 from the data sets (n = 8) gave a positive dominate Lyapunov exponent (0.29-0.64, p {\textless} 0.0001), a positive entropy (0.039-0.061, p {\textless} 0.0001), and a noninteger correlation dimension (1.1-1.9). These were evidences of a chaotic dynamic system. We therefore concluded that the original ECG signals must also have chaotic properties. The chaotic parameters did not show significant differences among the eight data sets representing normal sinus rhythm and various abnormalities. This study has demonstrated an effective way to characterize nonlinearities in nonstationary ECG signals by combining the empirical mode decomposition and the chaos analysis methods.},

    abstract         = {Experimental measurements of physical systems often have a limited number of independent channels, causing essential dynamical variables to remain unobserved. However, many popular methods for unsupervised inference of latent dynamics from experimental data implicitly assume that the measurements have higher intrinsic dimensionality than the underlying system---making coordinate identification a dimensionality reduction problem. Here, we study the opposite limit, in which hidden governing coordinates must be inferred from only a low-dimensional time series of measurements. Inspired by classical analysis techniques for partial observations of chaotic attractors, we introduce a general embedding technique for univariate and multivariate time series, consisting of an autoencoder trained with a novel latent-space loss function. We show that our technique reconstructs the strange attractors of synthetic and real-world systems better than existing techniques, and that it creates consistent, predictive representations of even stochastic systems. We conclude by using our technique to discover dynamical attractors in diverse systems such as patient electrocardiograms, household electricity usage, neural spiking, and eruptions of the Old Faithful geyser---demonstrating diverse applications of our technique for exploratory data analysis.},

While many processes in nature seem very unlikely a priori to be linear, the possible nonlinear nature might not be evident in specific aspects of their dynamics. The method of surrogate data has become a very popular tool to address such a question. However, while it was meant to provide a statistically rigorous, foolproof framework, some limitations and caveats have shown up in its practical use. In this paper, recent efforts to understand the caveats, avoid the pitfalls, and to overcome some of the limitations, are reviewed and augmented by new material. In particular, we will discuss specific as well as more general approaches to constrained randomisation, providing a full range of examples. New algorithms will be introduced for unevenly sampled and multivariate data and for surrogate spike trains. The main limitation, which lies in the interpretability of the test results, will be illustrated through instructive case studies. We will also discuss some implementational aspects of the realisation of these methods in the TISEAN software package.},

Surrogate data testing is an essential part of many of these methods, as it enables robust statistical evaluations to ensure that the results observed are not obtained by chance, but are a true characteristic of the underlying system. The surrogate data technique is based on the comparison of a particular property of the data (a discriminating statistic) with the distribution of the same property calculated in a set of constructed signals (surrogates) which match the original data set but do not possess the property that is being tested. Fourier transform based surrogates remain the most popular, yet many more options have since been developed to test increasingly varied null hypotheses while characterizing the dynamics of complex systems, including uncorrelated and correlated noise, coupling between systems, and synchronization. Here, we provide a detailed overview of a wide range of surrogate types, discuss their practical applications and demonstrate their use in both numerically simulated and real experimental systems. We also compare the performance of various surrogate types for the detection of nonlinearity, synchronization and coherence, coupling strength between systems, and the nature of coupling. A MatLab toolbox for many of the surrogate methods is provided.},

    abstract         = {Recording many neurons for a long time The ultimate aim of chronic recordings is to sample from the same neuron over days and weeks. However, this goal has been difficult to achieve for large populations of neurons. Steinmetz et al. describe the development and testing of Neuropixels 2.0. This new electrophysiological recording tool is a miniaturized, high-density probe for both acute and long-term experiments combined with sophisticated software algorithms for fully automatic post hoc computational stabilization. The technique also provides a strategy for extending the number of recorded sites beyond the number of available recording channels. In freely moving animals, extremely large numbers of individual neurons could thus be followed and tracked with the same probe for weeks and occasionally months. Science, this issue p. eabf4588 Structured Abstract INTRODUCTIONElectrode arrays based on complementary metal-oxide semiconductor silicon fabrication technology, such as Neuropixels probes, have enabled recordings of thousands of individual neurons in the living brain. These tools have led to discoveries about the brain-wide correlates of perception and action, primarily when used in acute, head-fixed recordings. To study the dynamics of neuronal processing across time scales, however, it is necessary to record from neurons over weeks and months, ideally during unrestrained behavior and in small animals, such as mice. RATIONALETo this end, we designed a miniaturized probe, called Neuropixels 2.0, with 5120 recording sites distributed over four shanks. The probe and headstage were miniaturized to about one-third of the original size (i.e., the size of the Neuropixels 1.0 probe), so that two probes and their single headstage weigh only {\textasciitilde}1.1 g, without loss of channel count (384 channels per probe). Using two four-shank probes provides 10,240 recording sites in one implant. To achieve stable recordings despite brain movement, we optimized the recording site arrangement. The probe has a denser, linearized geometry that allows for post hoc computational motion correction using a newly designed algorithm. This algorithm, implemented in the Kilosort 2.5 software package, determines the motion over time from the spiking data and corrects it with spatial resampling, as in image registration. RESULTSTo validate these probes for long-term recordings, we implanted them chronically in 21 rats and mice in six laboratories. Twenty of these 21 implants succeeded and yielded neurons over weeks and months while retaining good signal quality. The probes were reliably recoverable using newly engineered implant fixture designs.To test the performance of the motion correction algorithm, we performed recordings with known imposed motion of the probe relative to the brain. The algorithm improved the yield of stable neurons and largely eliminated the impact of motion on the recording.A version of this algorithm allowed the recording of neurons stably across days. We assessed this by “fingerprinting” individual chronically recorded neurons in the primary visual cortex using their distinctive visual responses to a battery of images. Neuron tracking was {\textgreater}90\% successful for up to 2 weeks and {\textgreater}80\% successful for up to 2 months. CONCLUSIONThis work demonstrates a suite of electrophysiological tools comprising a miniaturized high-density probe, recoverable chronic implant fixtures, and algorithms for automatic post hoc motion correction. These tools enable an order-of-magnitude increase in the number of sites that can be recorded in small animals, such as mice, and the ability to record from them stably over long time scales. {\textless}img class=fragment-image aria-describedby=F1-caption src=https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/372/6539/eabf4588/F1.medium.gif/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Neuropixels 2.0 probes allow unprecedented recordings.(A) Comparison of the Neuropixels 1.0 and 2.0 device designs.

(C) Example spiking rasters from two Neuropixels 2.0 probes chronically implanted in a mouse, showing spikes recorded on 6144 of the 10,240 sites available across the two probes. Eight sequential recordings (different colors) were performed from 768 channels each. Measuring the dynamics of neural processing across time scales requires following the spiking of thousands of individual neurons over milliseconds and months. To address this need, we introduce the Neuropixels 2.0 probe together with newly designed analysis algorithms. The probe has more than 5000 sites and is miniaturized to facilitate chronic implants in small mammals and recording during unrestrained behavior. High-quality recordings over long time scales were reliably obtained in mice and rats in six laboratories. Improved site density and arrangement combined with newly created data processing methods enable automatic post hoc correction for brain movements, allowing recording from the same neurons for more than 2 months. These probes and algorithms enable stable recordings from thousands of sites during free behavior, even in small animals such as mice. An approach has been developed that allows recording from the same neurons in a freely behaving animal for weeks and months.

    abstract         = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Neurons in the brain interact through a complex network of recurrent connections, but how complex is their activity? This is measured by dimensionality: the number of degrees of freedom in network activity. We use a novel type of network theory to identify a regime where network connectivity constrains and controls dimensionality – the strongly coupled \textit{sensitive regime}. Through new analysis of high-density Neuropixels recordings, we find strong evidence that areas across the mouse brain operate in this sensitive regime. We then study connectivity within brain areas via analysis of a massive, newly released synaptic physiology dataset from both mouse and human. We quantify the building blocks of this connectivity in terms of network motifs, and find that cell-type specific synaptic motifs that impact the sensitive regime are prevalent in both mouse and human brains. Thus, we propose that local circuitry strongly constrains and controls the dimensionality of brain networks.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

    abstract         = {Finding a code to unravel the population of neural responses that leads to a distinct animal behavior has been a long-standing question in the field of neuroscience. With the recent advances in machine learning, it is shown that the hierarchically Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) perform optimally in decoding unique features out of complex datasets. In this study, we utilize the power of a DNN to explore the computational principles in the mammalian brain by exploiting the Neuropixel data from Allen Brain Institute. We decode the neural responses from mouse visual cortex to predict the presented stimuli to the animal for natural (bear, trees, cheetah, etc.) and artificial (drifted gratings, orientated bars, etc.) classes. Our results indicate that neurons in mouse visual cortex encode the features of natural and artificial objects in a distinct manner, and such neural code is consistent across animals. We investigate this by applying transfer learning to train a DNN on the neural responses of a single animal and test its generalized performance across multiple animals. Within a single animal, DNN is able to decode the neural responses with as much as 100\% classification accuracy. Across animals, this accuracy is reduced to 91\%. This study demonstrates the potential of utilizing the DNN models as a computational framework to understand the neural coding principles in the mammalian brain.},

Here we describe a large, open dataset—part of the Allen Brain Observatory2—that surveys spiking from tens of thousands of units in six cortical and two thalamic regions in the brains of mice responding to a battery of visual stimuli. Using cross-correlation analysis, we reveal that the organization of inter-area functional connectivity during visual stimulation mirrors the anatomical hierarchy from the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas3. We find that four classical hierarchical measures—response latency, receptive-field size, phase-locking to drifting gratings and response decay timescale—are all correlated with the hierarchy. Moreover, recordings obtained during a visual task reveal that the correlation between neural activity and behavioural choice also increases along the hierarchy. Our study provides a foundation for understanding coding and signal propagation across hierarchically organized cortical and thalamic visual areas.},

Across all stimulus conditions tested, we observe a larger fraction of responsive neurons in electrophysiology and higher stimulus selectivity in calcium imaging, which was partially reconciled by applying a spikes-to-calcium forward model to the electrophysiology data. However, the forward model could only reconcile differences in responsiveness when restricted to neurons with low contamination and an event rate above a minimum threshold.

Neural population analyses often reduce the data dimensionality to focus on relevant activity patterns. A major hurdle to data analysis is spike sorting, and this problem is growing as the number of recorded neurons increases. Here, we investigate whether spike sorting is necessary to estimate neural population dynamics. The theory of random projections suggests that we can accurately estimate the geometry of low-dimensional manifolds from a small number of linear projections of the data. We recorded data using Neuropixels probes in motor cortex of nonhuman primates and reanalyzed data from three previous studies and found that neural dynamics and scientific conclusions are quite similar using multiunit threshold crossings rather than sorted neurons. This finding unlocks existing data for new analyses and informs the design and use of new electrode arrays for laboratory and clinical use.},

    abstract         = {Neighbor embeddings are a family of methods for visualizing complex high-dimensional datasets using kNN graphs. To find the low-dimensional embedding, these algorithms combine an attractive force between neighboring pairs of points with a repulsive force between all points. One of the most popular examples of such algorithms is t-SNE. Here we show that changing the balance between the attractive and the repulsive forces in t-SNE yields a spectrum of embeddings, which is characterized by a simple trade-off: stronger attraction can better represent continuous manifold structures, while stronger repulsion can better represent discrete cluster structures. We show that UMAP embeddings correspond to t-SNE with increased attraction; this happens because the negative sampling optimisation strategy employed by UMAP strongly lowers the effective repulsion. Likewise, ForceAtlas2, commonly used for visualizing developmental single-cell transcriptomic data, yields embeddings corresponding to t-SNE with the attraction increased even more. At the extreme of this spectrum lies Laplacian Eigenmaps, corresponding to zero repulsion. Our results demonstrate that many prominent neighbor embedding algorithms can be placed onto this attraction-repulsion spectrum, and highlight the inherent trade-offs between them.},

Here we delineate the spatial distribution of neurons underlying these processes. We used Neuropixels probes1,2 to record from approximately 30,000 neurons in 42 brain regions of mice performing a visual discrimination task3. Neurons in nearly all regions responded non-specifically when the mouse initiated an action. By contrast, neurons encoding visual stimuli and upcoming choices occupied restricted regions in the neocortex, basal ganglia and midbrain. Choice signals were rare and emerged with indistinguishable timing across regions. Midbrain neurons were activated before contralateral choices and were suppressed before ipsilateral choices, whereas forebrain neurons could prefer either side. Brain-wide pre-stimulus activity predicted engagement in individual trials and in the overall task, with enhanced subcortical but suppressed neocortical activity during engagement. These results reveal organizing principles for the distribution of neurons encoding behaviourally relevant variables across the mouse brain.},

    abstract         = {Complex systems are characterised by specific time-dependent interactions among their many constituents. As a consequence they often manifest rich, non-trivial and unexpected behaviour. Examples arise both in the physical and non-physical worlds. The study of complex systems forms a new interdisciplinary research area that cuts across physics, biology, ecology, economics, sociology, and the humanities. In this paper we review the essence of complex systems from a physicists' point of view, and try to clarify what makes them conceptually different from systems that are traditionally studied in physics. Our goal is to demonstrate how the dynamics of such systems may be conceptualised in quantitative and predictive terms by extending notions from statistical physics and how they can often be captured in a framework of co-evolving multiplex network structures. We mention three areas of complex-systems science that are currently studied extensively, the science of cities, dynamics of societies, and the representation of texts as evolutionary objects. We discuss why these areas form complex systems in the above sense. We argue that there exists plenty of new ground for physicists to explore and that methodical and conceptual progress is needed most.},

    abstract         = {Time series classification is an important task with many challenging applications. A nearest neighbor (NN) classifier with dynamic time warping (DTW) distance is a strong solution in this context. On the other hand, feature-based approaches have been proposed as both classifiers and to provide insight into the series, but these approaches have problems handling translations and dilations in local patterns. Considering these shortcomings, we present a framework to classify time series based on a bag-of-features representation (TSBF). Multiple subsequences selected from random locations and of random lengths are partitioned into shorter intervals to capture the local information. Consequently, features computed from these subsequences measure properties at different locations and dilations when viewed from the original series. This provides a feature-based approach that can handle warping (although differently from DTW). Moreover, a supervised learner (that handles mixed data types, different units, etc.) integrates location information into a compact codebook through class probability estimates. Additionally, relevant global features can easily supplement the codebook. TSBF is compared to NN classifiers and other alternatives (bag-of-words strategies, sparse spatial sample kernels, shapelets). Our experimental results show that TSBF provides better results than competitive methods on benchmark datasets from the UCR time series database.},

This approach does not depend on the knowledge of particular damage physics, and is appropriate for systems where damage evolves on much slower time scale than the directly observable dynamics. In an experimental context, the phase space reconstruction and locally linear models are used to quantify small distortions occurring in a dynamical system's phase space due to damage accumulation. These measurements are then related to the drifts in damage variables. A mathematical model of a harmonically driven cantilever beam in a force field of two battery-powered electromagnets is used to demonstrate validity of the method. It is explicitly demonstrated that an affine projection of the described feature vector accurately tracks the two competing damage processes. For practical damage identification purposes, the tracking data is analyzed using the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and smooth orthogonal decomposition (SOD) methods. Both methods correctly identify the two dominant damage modes. However, the SOD is more impervious to changes in fast-time dynamics and provides a significantly better signal-to-noise ratio. The damage modes identified using SOD are demonstrated to be within a linear transformation from the actual damage states and can be used to reconstruct the corresponding phase space trajectory.},

Using Fourier detrended fluctuation analysis, the sinusoidal trend is eliminated. The Hurst exponent of the time series without the sinusoidal trend is 0.12 ± 0.01. Also we find that these fluctuations have multifractal nature. Comparing the MF-DFA results for the remaining data set to those for shuffled and surrogate series, we conclude that its multifractal nature is almost entirely due to long range correlations. ©2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

    abstract         = {Task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging (TF-fMRI) has great potential for advancing the understanding and treatment of neurologic illness. However, as with all measures of neural activity, variability is a hallmark of intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) identified by TF-fMRI. This variability has hampered efforts to define a robust metric of connectivity suitable as a biomarker for neurologic illness. We hypothesized that some of this variability rather than representing noise in the measurement process, is related to a fundamental feature of connectivity within ICNs, which is their non-stationary nature. To test this hypothesis, we used a large (n = 892) population-based sample of older subjects to construct a well characterized atlas of 68 functional regions, which were categorized based on independent component analysis network of origin, anatomical locations, and a functional meta-analysis. These regions were then used to construct dynamic graphical representations of brain connectivity within a sliding time window for each subject. This allowed us to demonstrate the non-stationary nature of the brain’s modular organization and assign each region to a “meta-modular” group. Using this grouping, we then compared dwell time in strong sub-network configurations of the default mode network (DMN) between 28 subjects with Alzheimer’s dementia and 56 cognitively normal elderly subjects matched 1:2 on age, gender, and education. We found that differences in connectivity we and others have previously observed in Alzheimer’s disease can be explained by differences in dwell time in DMN sub-network configurations, rather than steady state connectivity magnitude. DMN dwell time in specific modular configurations may also underlie the TF-fMRI findings that have been described in mild cognitive impairment and cognitively normal subjects who are at risk for Alzheimer’s dementia.},

While a good understanding of the onset of chaos has been achieved, using as a mathematical tool the geometric theory of differentiable dynamical systems, moderately excited chaotic systems require new tools, which are provided by the ergodic theory of dynamical systems. This theory has reached a stage where fruitful contact and exchange with physical experiments has become widespread. The present review is an account of the main mathematical ideas and their concrete implementation in analyzing experiments. The main subjects are the theory of dimensions (number of excited degrees of freedom), entropy (production of information), and characteristic exponents (describing sensitivity to initial conditions). The relations between these quantities, as well as their experimental determination, are discussed. The systematic investigation of these quantities provides us for the first time with a reasonable understanding of dynamical systems, excited well beyond the quasiperiodic regimes. This is another step towards understanding highly turbulent fluids.},

    abstract         = {By using single-point measurements in space physics it is possible to study a phenomenon only as a function of time. This means that we cannot have direct access to information about spatial variations of a measured quantity. However, the investigation of the properties of turbulence and of related phenomena in the solar wind widely makes use of an approximation frequently adopted in hydrodynamics under certain conditions, the so-called Taylor hypothesis; indeed, the solar wind flow has a bulk velocity along the radial direction which is much higher than the velocity of a single turbulent eddy embedded in the main flow. This implies that the time of evolution of the turbulent features is longer than the transit time of the flow through the spacecraft position, so that the turbulent field can be considered frozen into the solar wind flow. This assumption allows one to easily associate time variations with spatial variations and stationarity to homogeneity. We have investigated, applying criteria for weak stationarity to Ulysses magnetic field data in different solar wind regimes, at which timescale and under which conditions the hypothesis of stationarity, and then of homogeneity, of turbulence in the solar wind is well justified. We extend the conclusions of previous studies by Matthaeus \& Goldstein to different parameter ranges in the solar wind. We conclude that the stationarity assumption in the inertial range of turbulence on timescales of 10 minutes to 1 day is reasonably satisfied in fast and uniform solar wind flows, but that in mixed, interacting fast, and slow solar wind streams the assumption is frequently only marginally valid.},

Several time periods, including a span of nearly two years, are analyzed. Data intervals that span many solar rotations are found to satisfy the conditions of ‘weak’ stationarity if the effects of solar rotation are included in the asymptotic analysis. Shorter intervals, which include a small integral number of interplanetary sectors, also satisfy weak stationarity.

    abstract         = {Structure and function go hand in hand. However, while a complex structure can be relatively safely broken down into the minutest parts, and technology is now delving into nanoscales, the function of complex systems requires a completely different approach. Here the complexity clearly arises from nonlinear interactions, which prevents us from obtaining a realistic description of a system by dissecting it into its structural component parts. At best, the result of such investigations does not substantially add to our understanding or at worst it can even be misleading. Not surprisingly, the dynamics of complex systems, facilitated by increasing computational efficiency, is now readily tackled in the case of measured time series. Moreover, time series can now be collected in practically every branch of science and in any structural scale—from protein dynamics in a living cell to data collected in astrophysics or even via social networks. In searching for deterministic patterns in such data we are limited by the fact that no complex system in the real world is autonomous. Hence, as an alternative to the stochastic approach that is predominantly applied to data from inherently non-autonomous complex systems, theory and methods specifically tailored to non-autonomous systems are needed. Indeed, in the last decade we have faced a huge advance in mathematical methods, including the introduction of pullback attractors, as well as time series methods that cope with the most important characteristic of non-autonomous systems—their time-dependent behaviour. Here we review current methods for the analysis of non-autonomous dynamics including those for extracting properties of interactions and the direction of couplings. We illustrate each method by applying it to three sets of systems typical for chaotic, stochastic and non-autonomous behaviour. For the chaotic class we select the Lorenz system, for the stochastic the noise-forced Duffing system and for the non-autonomous the Poincaré oscillator with quasi-periodic forcing. In this way we not only discuss and review each method, but also present properties which help to clearly distinguish the three classes of systems when analysed in an inverse approach—from measured, or numerically generated data. In particular, this review provides a framework to tackle inverse problems in these areas and clearly distinguish non-autonomous dynamics from chaos or stochasticity.},

Stationarity is a necessary condition for many concepts in dynamical systems theory, e.g. deterministic chaos. Therefore, testing for stationarity should necessarily be the first step in any data analysis. Above all, this testing is highly important whenever one deals with systems for which stationarity is not guaranteed by the data acquisition procedure: if only short and unique time series are accessible and if the experimental situation is not or only restrictedly controllable, as for instance in astronomy, economy, or medicine.  The proposed stationarity test is easily workable and easy to implement in the form of a systematically searching loop. It singles out the parts of a time series which are a reasonable input to a dimension estimate algorithm. Thereby, it can ascertain finite correlation dimensions which are not indicative of deterministic behavior; this kind of dimensions can occur in stochastic processes which are nonstationary, e.g. self-affine.},

    abstract         = {Statistical signal processing applications usually require the estimation of some parameters of interest given a set of observed data. These estimates are typically obtained either by solving a multi-variate optimization problem, as in the maximum likelihood (ML) or maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimators, or by performing a multi-dimensional integration, as in the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimators. Unfortunately, analytical expressions for these estimators cannot be found in most real-world applications, and the Monte Carlo (MC) methodology is one feasible approach. MC methods proceed by drawing random samples, either from the desired distribution or from a simpler one, and using them to compute consistent estimators. The most important families of MC algorithms are the Markov chain MC (MCMC) and importance sampling (IS). On the one hand, MCMC methods draw samples from a proposal density, building then an ergodic Markov chain whose stationary distribution is the desired distribution by accepting or rejecting those candidate samples as the new state of the chain. On the other hand, IS techniques draw samples from a simple proposal density and then assign them suitable weights that measure their quality in some appropriate way. In this paper, we perform a thorough review of MC methods for the estimation of static parameters in signal processing applications. A historical note on the development of MC schemes is also provided, followed by the basic MC method and a brief description of the rejection sampling (RS) algorithm, as well as three sections describing many of the most relevant MCMC and IS algorithms, and their combined use. Finally, five numerical examples (including the estimation of the parameters of a chaotic system, a localization problem in wireless sensor networks and a spectral analysis application) are provided in order to demonstrate the performance of the described approaches.},

The series expansion in the deflection angle cannot be used to simulate accurate CMB maps, so a pixel remapping must be used. For parameter estimation accounting for the change in the power spectrum but assuming Gaussianity is sufficient to obtain accurate results up to Planck sensitivity using current tools. A fuller analysis may be required to obtain accurate error estimates and for more sensitive observations.

    abstract         = {The question whether a physical model structure is identifiable is usually considered in a qualitative way, i.e. it is answered with a yes/no answer. However when considering parameters in large scale (nonlinear) physical models it is relevant to raise the question how the notion of identifiability can be quantified. This implies addressing the question how the model structure can be approximated so as to achieve identifiability, while retaining the interpretation of the physical parameters. In this paper this problem is addressed in a prediction error setting, and it is shown how the construction of best locally identifiable model structure approximations relates to notions of controllability and observability. Additionally the analysis in terms of an prediction error approach relates to iterative optimization algorithms (like Gauss-Newton and Steepest-Descent) and to Bayesian parameter estimation.},

The development of mathematical methods to investigate structural nonidentifiability has a long tradition. Computationally efficient methods to detect and cure it have been developed recently. Practical nonidentifiability, on the other hand, has not been investigated at the same conceptually clear level. We argue that practical identifiability is more challenging than structural identifiability when it comes to modeling experimental data. We discuss that the classical approach based on the Fisher information matrix has severe shortcomings. As an alternative, we propose using the profile likelihood, which is a powerful approach to detect and resolve practical nonidentifiability.},

Uncorrelated parameters can be seen as the key tuning knobs of a predictive model.

    abstract         = {Background Models for complex biological systems may involve a large number of parameters. It may well be that some of these parameters cannot be derived from observed data via regression techniques. Such parameters are said to be unidentifiable, the remaining parameters being identifiable. Closely related to this idea is that of redundancy, that a set of parameters can be expressed in terms of some smaller set. Before data is analysed it is critical to determine which model parameters are identifiable or redundant to avoid ill-defined and poorly convergent regression. Methodology/Principal Findings In this paper we outline general considerations on parameter identifiability, and introduce the notion of weak local identifiability and gradient weak local identifiability. These are based on local properties of the likelihood, in particular the rank of the Hessian matrix. We relate these to the notions of parameter identifiability and redundancy previously introduced by Rothenberg (Econometrica 39 (1971) 577–591) and Catchpole and Morgan (Biometrika 84 (1997) 187–196). Within the widely used exponential family, parameter irredundancy, local identifiability, gradient weak local identifiability and weak local identifiability are shown to be largely equivalent. We consider applications to a recently developed class of cancer models of Little and Wright (Math Biosciences 183 (2003) 111–134) and Little et al. (J Theoret Biol 254 (2008) 229–238) that generalize a large number of other recently used quasi-biological cancer models. Conclusions/Significance We have shown that the previously developed concepts of parameter local identifiability and redundancy are closely related to the apparently weaker properties of weak local identifiability and gradient weak local identifiability—within the widely used exponential family these concepts largely coincide.},

    abstract         = {Linear dimensionality reduction methods are a cornerstone of analyzing high dimensional data, due to their simple geometric interpretations and typically attractive computational properties. These methods capture many data features of interest, such as covariance, dynamical structure, correlation between data sets, input-output relationships, and margin between data classes. Methods have been developed with a variety of names and motivations in many fields, and perhaps as a result the connections between all these methods have not been highlighted. Here we survey methods from this disparate literature as optimization programs over matrix manifolds. We discuss principal component analysis, factor analysis, linear multidimensional scaling, Fisher's linear discriminant analysis, canonical correlations analysis, maximum autocorrelation factors, slow feature analysis, sufficient dimensionality reduction, undercomplete independent component analysis, linear regression, distance metric learning, and more. This optimization framework gives insight to some rarely discussed shortcomings of well-known methods, such as the suboptimality of certain eigenvector solutions. Modern techniques for optimization over matrix manifolds enable a generic linear dimensionality reduction solver, which accepts as input data and an objective to be optimized, and returns, as output, an optimal low-dimensional projection of the data. This simple optimization framework further allows straightforward generalizations and novel variants of classical methods, which we demonstrate here by creating an orthogonal-projection canonical correlations analysis. More broadly, this survey and generic solver suggest that linear dimensionality reduction can move toward becoming a blackbox, objective-agnostic numerical technology.},

This is particularly important for high-dimensional data that lie on several different, but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as images ofobjects from multiple classes seen from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure of very large data sets, we show how t-SNE can use random walks on neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the data to influence the way in which a subset of the data is displayed. We illustrate the performance of t-SNE on a wide variety of data sets and compare it with many other non-parametric visualization techniques, including Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding. The visualizations produced by t-SNE are significantly better than those produced by the other techniques on almost all of the data sets.},

Tangent space projection is estimated at each data point on the manifold, through which the data point itself and its neighbors are represented in tangent space with local coordinates. Splines are then constructed to guarantee that each of the local coordinates can be mapped to its own single global coordinate with respect to the underlying manifold. Thus, the compatibility between local alignments is ensured. In such a work setting, we develop an optimization framework based on reconstruction error analysis, which can yield a global optimum.

This analysis used a recursive principal-component analysis developed specifically for large data sets. This analysis is interpreted in terms of functional connectivity, defined as the temporal correlation of a neurophysiological index measured in different brain areas. The results suggest that the variance in neurophysiological measurements, introduced experimentally, was accounted for by two independent principal components. The first, and considerably larger, highlighted an intentional brain system seen in previous studies of verbal fluency. The second identified a distributed brain system including the anterior cingulate and Wernicke's area that reflected monotonic time effects. We propose that this system has an attentional bias.},

The effect and significance of climate change were firstly evaluated using time as the only predictor and t-test. It was found that both the temperature and humidity increased in most States. Around one third of the 800 weather stations record variation of freeze and precipitation classifications and a few of them show significant change of classifications over time based on the results of logistic regression analyses. Three unsupervised machine learning including Principle Component Analysis (PCA), factor analysis and cluster analysis were conducted to identify the main component and common factors for climatic variables, and then to classify datasets into different groups. Then, two supervised machine learning methods including Fisher’s discriminant analysis and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) were adopted to predict the climatic regions based on climatic data. Results of PCA and factor analysis show that temperature and humidity are the first two principle components and common factors, accounting for 71.6\% of the variance. The 4-means clusters include wet no freeze, dry no freeze, dry freeze and snow freeze. The best k-mean clustering suggested 9 clusters with more temperature clusters. Both the Fisher’s linear discriminant analysis and ANN can effectively predict climatic regions with multiple climatic variables. ANN performs better with higher R square and low misclassification rate, especially for those with more layers and nodes.},

Various methods have been proposed to depict the long-range temporal dependence, including autocorrelation function analysis, spectral analysis and fractal analysis. However, few researches have studied the daily temporal dependence (i.e. the similarity between different daily traffic flow time series), which can help us better understand the long-range temporal dependence, such as the origin of crossover phenomenon. Moreover, considering both types of dependence contributes to establishing more accurate model and depicting the properties of traffic flow time series. In this paper, we study the properties of daily temporal dependence by simple average method and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based method. Meanwhile, we also study the long-range temporal dependence by Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) and Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MFDFA). The results show that both the daily and long-range temporal dependence exert considerable influence on the traffic flow series. The DFA results reveal that the daily temporal dependence creates crossover phenomenon when estimating the Hurst exponent which depicts the long-range temporal dependence. Furthermore, through the comparison of the DFA test, PCA-based method turns out to be a better method to extract the daily temporal dependence especially when the difference between days is significant.},

    abstract         = {The next generation of gravitational wave detectors will improve the detection prospects for gravitational waves from core-collapse supernovae. The complex astrophysics involved in core-collapse supernovae pose a significant challenge to modeling such phenomena. The Supernova Model Evidence Extractor (SMEE) attempts to capture the main features of gravitational wave signals from core-collapse supernovae by using numerical relativity waveforms to create approximate models. These models can then be used to perform Bayesian model selection to determine if the targeted astrophysical feature is present in the gravitational wave signal. In this paper, we extend SMEE’s model selection capabilities to include features in the gravitational wave signal that are associated with g-modes and the standing accretion shock instability. For the first time, we test SMEE’s performance using simulated data for planned future detectors, such as the Einstein Telescope, Cosmic Explorer, and LIGO Voyager. Further to this, we show how the performance of SMEE is improved by creating models from the spectrograms of supernova waveforms instead of their time-series waveforms that contain stochastic features. In third generation detector configurations, we find that about 50\% of neutrino-driven simulations were detectable at 100 kpc, and 10\% at 275 kpc. The explosion mechanism was correctly determined for all detected signals.},

We apply PCA to a set of gravitational waveforms produced by rotating stellar core-collapse simulations and compare its basis vectors with those obtained through Gram–Schmidt decomposition. The comparison is made using the match parameter which quantifies how well each waveform is reconstructed by a set of basis vectors. The performance of the two methods is found to be comparable with 14 Gram–Schmidt basis vectors and 12 principal components required if we require all waveforms in the catalogue to be reconstructed with a match of 0.9 or better. Additionally, we observe that the chosen set of waveforms has very similar features, and a match of at least 0.7 can be obtained by decomposing only waveforms generated from simulations with A = 2. We discuss the implications of this observation and the advantages of eigen-decomposing waveform catalogues with PCA.},

Invariances, whether translational or rotational, are well known to compromise the ability of ROMs to produce accurate and/or low-rank representations of the spatiotemporal dynamics. However, by discovering translations in a principled way, data can be shifted into a coordinate systems where quality, low-dimensional ROMs can be constructed. This approach can be used on either numerical or experimental data with or without knowledge of the governing equations. We demonstrate our method on a variety of PDEs of increasing difficulty, taken from the field of fluid dynamics, showing the efficacy and robustness of the proposed approach.},

In an attempt to overcome this challenge, a new method for dimensionality reduction is presented that scales as p log(p), where p is the number of design variables. It works by taking advantage of adjoint design methods to compute the covariance matrix of the gradient. This information is then used with principal component analysis to develop a linear transformation that allows an aerodynamic optimization problem to be reformulated in an equivalent coordinate system of lower dimensionality. To demonstrate its feasibility, the method is tested on a two-dimensional staggered airfoil problem, intentionally chosen as an abstraction of a more realistic overwing nacelle integration problem, and shown to exhibit similarities with the latter. Results show that the method rivals typical screening methods used in aerospace engineering in terms of effectiveness but outperforms them either in terms of cost or the ability to capture nonlinear effects. Furthermore, the method is found to show good agreement with optimization results obtained without using the method. Overall, results offer strong evidence in support of the proposed approach, setting the stage for larger analytical efforts such as design space exploration, where dimensionality reduction is unavoidable to cope with the necessity of gradient-free approaches.},

    abstract         = {Capturing the dynamical properties of time series concisely as interpretable feature vectors can enable efficient clustering and classification for time-series applications across science and industry. Selecting an appropriate feature-based representation of time series for a given application can be achieved through systematic comparison across a comprehensive time-series feature library, such as those in the hctsa toolbox. However, this approach is computationally expensive and involves evaluating many similar features, limiting the widespread adoption of feature-based representations of time series for real-world applications. In this work, we introduce a method to infer small sets of time-series features that (i) exhibit strong classification performance across a given collection of time-series problems, and (ii) are minimally redundant. Applying our method to a set of 93 time-series classification datasets (containing over 147,000 time series) and using a filtered version of the hctsa feature library (4791 features), we introduce a set of 22 CAnonical Time-series CHaracteristics, catch22, tailored to the dynamics typically encountered in time-series data-mining tasks. This dimensionality reduction, from 4791 to 22, is associated with an approximately 1000-fold reduction in computation time and near linear scaling with time-series length, despite an average reduction in classification accuracy of just 7\%. catch22 captures a diverse and interpretable signature of time series in terms of their properties, including linear and non-linear autocorrelation, successive differences, value distributions and outliers, and fluctuation scaling properties. We provide an efficient implementation of catch22, accessible from many programming environments, that facilitates feature-based time-series analysis for scientific, industrial, financial and medical applications using a common language of interpretable time-series properties.},

    abstract         = {Complex cognitive functions such as working memory and decision-making require information maintenance over seconds to years, from transient sensory stimuli to long-term contextual cues. While theoretical accounts predict the emergence of a corresponding hierarchy of neuronal timescales, direct electrophysiological evidence across the human cortex is lacking. Here, we infer neuronal timescales from invasive intracranial recordings. Timescales increase along the principal sensorimotor-to-association axis across the entire human cortex, and scale with single-unit timescales within macaques. Cortex-wide transcriptomic analysis shows direct alignment between timescales and expression of excitation- and inhibition-related genes, as well as genes specific to voltage-gated transmembrane ion transporters. Finally, neuronal timescales are functionally dynamic: prefrontal cortex timescales expand during working memory maintenance and predict individual performance, while cortex-wide timescales compress with aging. Thus, neuronal timescales follow cytoarchitectonic gradients across the human cortex and are relevant for cognition in both short and long terms, bridging microcircuit physiology with macroscale dynamics and behavior.},

    abstract         = {A long-lasting challenge in neuroscience has been to find a set of principles that could be used to organize the brain into distinct areas with specific functions. Recent studies have proposed the orderly progression in the time constants of neural dynamics as an organizational principle of cortical computations. However, relationships between these timescales and their dependence on response properties of individual neurons are unknown, making it impossible to determine how mechanisms underlying such a computational principle are related to other aspects of neural processing. Here, we developed a comprehensive method to simultaneously estimate multiple timescales in neuronal dynamics and integration of task-relevant signals along with selectivity to those signals. By applying our method to neural and behavioral data during a dynamic decision-making task, we found that most neurons exhibited multiple timescales in their response, which consistently increased from parietal to prefrontal and cingulate cortex. While predicting rates of behavioral adjustments, these timescales were not correlated across individual neurons in any cortical area, resulting in independent parallel hierarchies of timescales. Additionally, none of these timescales depended on selectivity to task-relevant signals. Our results not only suggest the existence of multiple canonical mechanisms for increasing timescales of neural dynamics across cortex but also point to additional mechanisms that allow decorrelation of these timescales to enable more flexibility.},

  abstract         = {In this paper, we suggest that cortical anatomy recapitulates the temporal hierarchy that is inherent in the dynamics of environmental states. Many aspects of brain function can be understood in terms of a hierarchy of temporal scales at which representations of the environment evolve. The lowest level of this hierarchy corresponds to fast fluctuations associated with sensory processing, whereas the highest levels encode slow contextual changes in the environment, under which faster representations unfold. First, we describe a mathematical model that exploits the temporal structure of fast sensory input to track the slower trajectories of their underlying causes. This model of sensory encoding or perceptual inference establishes a proof of concept that slowly changing neuronal states can encode the paths or trajectories of faster sensory states. We then review empirical evidence that suggests that a temporal hierarchy is recapitulated in the macroscopic organization of the cortex. This anatomic-temporal hierarchy provides a comprehensive framework for understanding cortical function: the specific time-scale that engages a cortical area can be inferred by its location along a rostro-caudal gradient, which reflects the anatomical distance from primary sensory areas. This is most evident in the prefrontal cortex, where complex functions can be explained as operations on representations of the environment that change slowly. The framework provides predictions about, and principled constraints on, cortical structure–function relationships, which can be tested by manipulating the time-scales of sensory input.},

    abstract         = {Human brain networks can be characterized at different temporal or spatial scales given by the age of the subject or the spatial resolution of the neuroimaging method. Integration of data across scales can only be successful if the combined networks show a similar architecture. One way to compare networks is to look at spatial features, based on fiber length, and topological features of individual nodes where outlier nodes form single node motifs whose frequency yields a fingerprint of the network. Here, we observe how characteristic single node motifs change over age (12–23 years) and network size (414, 813, and 1615 nodes) for diffusion tensor imaging structural connectivity in healthy human subjects. First, we find the number and diversity of motifs in a network to be strongly correlated. Second, comparing different scales, the number and diversity of motifs varied across the temporal (subject age) and spatial (network resolution) scale: certain motifs might only occur at one spatial scale or for a certain age range. Third, regions of interest which show one motif at a lower resolution may show a range of motifs at a higher resolution which may or may not include the original motif at the lower resolution. Therefore, both the type and localization of motifs differ for different spatial resolutions. Our results also indicate that spatial resolution has a higher effect on topological measures whereas spatial measures, based on fiber lengths, remain more comparable between resolutions. Therefore, spatial resolution is crucial when comparing characteristic node fingerprints given by topological and spatial network features. As node motifs are based on topological and spatial properties of brain connectivity networks, these conclusions are also relevant to other studies using connectome analysis.},

We demonstrate longer ACW-50 and ACW-0 in networks located at the core compared to those at the periphery with rest and task states showing a high ACW correlation. Calculating rest-task differences, i.e., subtracting the shared core-periphery organization, reveals task-specific ACW changes in distinct networks. Finally, employing kernel density estimation, machine learning, and simulation, we demonstrate that ACW-0 exhibits better prediction in classifying a region’s time window as core or periphery. Overall, our findings provide fundamental insight into how the human cortex’s temporal hierarchy converges with its spatial core-periphery hierarchy.},

While resting state fMRI reveals networks at an ultraslow timescale (below 0.1 Hz), other neuroimaging modalities such as MEG and EEG suggest that much faster timescales may be equally or more relevant for discovering spatiotemporal structure. Here, we introduce a novel way to generate whole-brain neural dynamical activity at the millisecond scale from fMRI signals. This method allows us to study the different timescales through binning the output of the model. These timescales can then be investigated using a method (poetically named brain songs) to extract the spacetime motifs at a given timescale. Using independent measures of entropy and hierarchy to characterize the richness of the dynamical repertoire, we show that both methods find a similar optimum at a timescale of around 200 ms in resting state and in task data.},

    abstract         = {The superior colliculus (SC) integrates information from multiple sensory modalities to facilitate the detection and localization of salient events. The efficacy of “multisensory integration” is traditionally measured by comparing the magnitude of the response elicited by a cross-modal stimulus to the responses elicited by its modality-specific component stimuli, and because there is an element of randomness in the system, these calculations are made using response values averaged over multiple stimulus presentations in an experiment. Recent evidence suggests that multisensory integration in the SC is highly plastic and these neurons adapt to specific anomalous stimulus configurations. This raises the question whether such adaptation occurs during an experiment with traditional stimulus configurations; that is, whether the state of the neuron and its integrative principles are the same at the beginning and end of the experiment, or whether they are altered as a consequence of exposure to the testing stimuli even when they are pseudo-randomly interleaved. We find that unisensory and multisensory responses do change during an experiment, and that these changes are predictable. Responses that are initially weak tend to potentiate, responses that are initially strong tend to habituate, and the efficacy of multisensory integration waxes or wanes accordingly during the experiment as predicted by the “principle of inverse effectiveness.” These changes are presumed to reflect two competing mechanisms in the SC: potentiation reflects increases in the expectation that a stimulus will occur at a given location relative to others, and habituation reflects decreases in stimulus novelty. These findings indicate plasticity in multisensory integration that allows animals to adapt to rapidly changing environmental events while suggesting important caveats in the interpretation of experimental data: the neuron studied at the beginning of an experiment is not the same at the end of it.},

Although power in all frequency bands increased progressively across motor behaviors, PSD centroid frequency increased only during sneezing (p{\textless}0.05). The non-stationary period at the onset of EMG activity ranged from ~80ms during airway occlusion to ~150ms during eupnea. Within the initial non-stationary period of EMG activity 80–95\% of motor units were recruited during different motor behaviors. Motor units augmented their discharge frequencies progressively beyond the non-stationary period; yet, EMG signal became stationary. In conclusion, non-stationarity of DIAm EMG reflects the period of motor unit recruitment, while a shift in the PSD towards higher frequencies reflects recruitment of more fatigable fast-twitch motor units.},

However, in vivo recordings from these devices often experience some shifting of the probe (due e.g. to animal movement), resulting in poorly localized voltage readings that in turn can corrupt estimates of neural activity. We introduce a new registration method to partially correct for this motion. In contrast to previous template-based registration methods, the proposed approach is decentralized, estimating shifts of the data recorded in multiple timebins with respect to one another, and then extracting a global registration estimate from the resulting estimated shift matrix. We find that the resulting decentralized registration is more robust and accurate than previous template-based approaches applied to both simulated and real data, but nonetheless some significant non-stationarity in the recovered neural activity remains that should be accounted for by downstream processing pipelines.

    abstract         = {The electroencephalogram (EEG), used to noninvasively monitor brain activity, remains the most reliable tool in the diagnosis of neonatal seizures. Due to their nonstationary and multi-component nature, newborn EEG seizures are better represented in the joint time-frequency domain than in either the time domain or the frequency domain. Characterising newborn EEG seizure nonstationarities helps to better understand their time-varying nature and, therefore, allow developing efficient signal processing methods for both modelling and seizure detection and classification. In this article, we used the instantaneous frequency (IF) extracted from a time-frequency distribution to characterise newborn EEG seizures. We fitted four frequency modulated (FM) models to the extracted IFs, namely a linear FM, a piecewise-linear FM, a sinusoidal FM, and a hyperbolic FM. Using a database of 30-s EEG seizure epochs acquired from 35 newborns, we were able to show that, depending on EEG channel, the sinusoidal and piecewise-linear FM models best fitted 80-98\% of seizure epochs. To further characterise the EEG seizures, we calculated the mean frequency and frequency span of the extracted IFs. We showed that in the majority of the cases ({\textgreater}95\%), the mean frequency resides in the 0.6-3 Hz band with a frequency span of 0.2-1 Hz. In terms of the frequency of occurrence of the four seizure models, the statistical analysis showed that there is no significant difference(p = 0.332) between the two hemispheres. The results also indicate that there is no significant differences between the two hemispheres in terms of the mean frequency (p = 0.186) and the frequency span (p = 0.302).},

    abstract         = {Although a number of methods have been proposed for classification of individual action potentials embedded in multi-unit activity, they have been challenged by non-stationarity. The waveform shapes of action potentials can change rapidly over time as a result of shifts in membrane conductances during extended burst firing sequences and more slowly over time due to electrode drift. These changes are typically non-Gaussian. We present an algorithm for waveform identification that makes no assumptions on the distribution of these shapes other than the change in waveform shape for a particular neuron should not be discontinuous. We apply this algorithm to the resolution of multi-unit neural signals recorded in the cat visual cortex and we compare this approach to a spike sorting method that is based on the Bayesian likelihood of a spike fitting a particular model (Lewicki, M.

    abstract         = {This research proposes a generic methodology for dimensionality reduction upon time–frequency representations applied to the classification of different types of biosignals. The methodology directly deals with the highly redundant and irrelevant data contained in these representations, combining a first stage of irrelevant data removal by variable selection, with a second stage of redundancy reduction using methods based on linear transformations. The study addresses two techniques that provided a similar performance: the first one is based on the selection of a set of the most relevant time–frequency points, whereas the second one selects the most relevant frequency bands. The first methodology needs a lower quantity of components, leading to a lower feature space; but the second improves the capture of the time-varying dynamics of the signal, and therefore provides a more stable performance. In order to evaluate the generalization capabilities of the methodology proposed it has been applied to two types of biosignals with different kinds of non-stationary behaviors: electroencephalographic and phonocardiographic biosignals. Even when these two databases contain samples with different degrees of complexity and a wide variety of characterizing patterns, the results demonstrate a good accuracy for the detection of pathologies, over 98\%. The results open the possibility to extrapolate the methodology to the study of other biosignals.},

The existing empirical wavelet transform (EWT) has been enhanced using Fourier–Bessel series expansion (FBSE) in order to obtain improved TF representation of non-stationary signals. We have used the FBSE method for the spectral representation of the analyzed multi-component signals with good frequency resolution. The scale-space based boundary detection method has been applied for the accurate estimation of boundary frequencies in the FBSE based spectrum of the signal. After that, wavelet based filter banks have been generated in order to decompose non-stationary multi-component signals into narrow-band components. Finally, the normalized Hilbert transform has been applied for the estimation of amplitude envelope and instantaneous frequency functions from the narrow-band components and obtained the TF representation of the analyzed non-stationary signal. We have applied our proposed method for the TF representation of multi-component synthetic signals and real electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. The proposed method has provided better TF representation as compared to existing EWT method and Hilbert–Huang transform (HHT) method, especially when analyzed signal possesses closed frequency components and of short time duration.},

It is commonly implied that there is such a thing as a complex system, different examples of which are studied across many disciplines. However, there is no concise definition of a complex system, let alone a definition on which all scientists agree. We review various attempts to characterize a complex system, and consider a core set of features that are widely associated with complex systems in the literature and by those in the field. We argue that some of these features are neither necessary nor sufficient for complexity, and that some of them are too vague or confused to be of any analytical use. In order to bring mathematical rigour to the issue we then review some standard measures of complexity from the scientific literature, and offer a taxonomy for them, before arguing that the one that best captures the qualitative notion of the order produced by complex systems is that of the Statistical Complexity. Finally, we offer our own list of necessary conditions as a characterization of complexity. These conditions are qualitative and may not be jointly sufficient for complexity. We close with some suggestions for future work.},

These fluctuations have often been linked to the presence of some kind of critical phenomena, where it is well known that the emerging correlation functions in space and time are closely related to each other. Here we test whether the time correlation properties allow systems exhibiting a phase transition to self-tune to their critical point. We describe results in three models: the 2D Ising ferromagnetic model, the 3D Vicsek flocking model and a small-world neuronal network model. We demonstrate that feedback from the autocorrelation function of the order parameter fluctuations shifts the system towards its critical point. Our results rely on universal properties of critical systems and are expected to be relevant to a variety of other settings.},

Traditional tools and approaches to study this architecture have largely focused on single scales—of topology, time, and space. Expanding beyond this narrow view, we focus this review on pertinent questions and novel methodological advances for the multi-scale brain. We separate our exposition into content related to multi-scale topological structure, multi-scale temporal structure, and multi-scale spatial structure. In each case, we recount empirical evidence for such structures, survey network-based methodological approaches to reveal these structures, and outline current frontiers and open questions. Although predominantly peppered with examples from human neuroimaging, we hope that this account will offer an accessible guide to any neuroscientist aiming to measure, characterize, and understand the full richness of the brain's multiscale network structure—irrespective of species, imaging modality, or spatial resolution.},

    abstract         = {Although graph theory has been around since the 18th century, the field of network science is more recent and continues to gain popularity, particularly in the field of neuroimaging. The field was propelled forward when Watts and Strogatz introduced their small-world network model, which described a network that provided regional specialization with efficient global information transfer. This model is appealing to the study of brain connectivity, as the brain can be viewed as a system with various interacting regions that produce complex behaviors. In practice, graph metrics such as clustering coefficient, path length, and efficiency measures are often used to characterize system properties. Centrality metrics such as degree, betweenness, closeness, and eigenvector centrality determine critical areas within the network. Community structure is also essential for understanding network organization and topology. Network science has led to a paradigm shift in the neuroscientific community, but it should be viewed as more than a simple “tool du jour.” To fully appreciate the utility of network science, a greater understanding of how network models apply to the brain is needed. An integrated appraisal of multiple network analyses should be performed to better understand network structure rather than focusing on univariate comparisons to find significant group differences; indeed, such comparisons, popular with traditional functional magnetic resonance imaging analyses, are arguably no longer relevant with graph-theory based approaches. These methods necessitate a philosophical shift toward complexity science. In this context, when correctly applied and interpreted, network scientific methods have a chance to revolutionize the understanding of brain function.},

Cortical activity showed a gradual progression from small to large scale processing, along three gradients extending anteriorly from the parahippocampal place area (PPA), retrosplenial complex (RSC) and occipital place area (OPA), and along the hippocampus posterior-anterior axis. Each of the cortical gradients overlapped with the visual system posteriorly and the default-mode network (DMN) anteriorly.

    abstract         = {Almost all aspects of neuronal function, from its maturation during development, to its growth and survival, cytoskeletal organization, gene expression, neurotransmission, and use-dependent modulation, are dependent on intracellular signaling initiated at the cell surface. The response of neurons and glia to neurotransmitters, growth factors, and other signaling molecules is determined by their complement of expressed receptors and pathways that transduce and transmit these signals to intracellular compartments; and the enzymes, ion channels, and cytoskeletal proteins that ultimately mediate the effects of the neurotransmitters. The molecules involved in signal transmission and transduction are highly represented in mammalian and invertebrate genomes. Individual neuronal responses are further determined by the concentration and localization of signal transduction components, many of which can be modified by the prior history of neuronal activity. Several primary classes of signaling systems, operating at different time courses, provide great flexibility for intercellular communication. One class comprises ligand-gated ion channels. This class of signaling provides fast transmission that is activated and deactivated within 10ms. It forms the underlying “hard wiring” of the nervous system that makes rapid multisynaptic computations possible. A second class consists of receptor tyrosine kinases, which typically respond to growth factors and to trophic factors and produce major changes in the growth, differentiation, or survival of neurons. A third and largest class utilizes G protein-linked signals in a multistep process that slows the response from 100–300ms to many minutes. The relatively slow speed is offset, however, by a richness in the diversity of its modulation and its inherent capacity for amplification and plasticity. The initial steps in this signaling system typically generate a second messenger inside the cell, and this second messenger then activates a number of proteins, including protein kinases that modify cellular processes. Signal transduction also modulates the level of transcription of genes, which determine the differentiated and functional state of cells.},

Given this, it is essential to determine the degree to which system features are determined by environmental conditions, and the degree to which they are the result of self-organization. Furthermore, given the multiple levels at which dynamics become apparent and at which selection can act, central issues relate to how evolution shapes ecosystems properties, and whether ecosystems become buffered to changes (more resilient) over their ecological and evolutionary development or proceed to critical states and the edge of chaos.},

This includes positive, zero, and some or all of the negative exponents. We show that even with very large data sets, it is clearly advantageous to use local neighborhood-to-neighborhood mappings with higher-order Taylor series, rather than just local linear maps as has been done previously. We give examples using up to fifth-order polynomials. We demonstrate this procedure on two familiar maps and two familiar flows: the Hénon and Ikeda maps of the plane to itself, the Lorenz system of three ordinary differential equations, and the Mackey-Glass delay differential equation. We stress the importance of maintaining two dimensions for converting the scalar data into time delay vectors: one is a global dimension to ensure proper unfolding of the attractor as a whole, and the other is a local dimension for capturing the local dynamics on the attractor. We show the effects of changing the local and global dimensions, changing the order of the mapping polynomial, and additive (measurement) noise. There will always be some limit to the number of exponents that can be accurately determined from a given finite data set. We discuss a method of determining this limit by numerically obtaining the singularity spectra of the data set and also show how it is often appropriate to make this choice based on the fractal dimension of the attractor. If excessively large dimensions are used, spurious exponents will be generated, and in some cases the accuracy of the true exponents will be affected. We present methods of identifying these spurious exponents by determining the Lyapunov direction vectors at particular points in the data set. We can then use these to identify numerical problems and to associate data-set singularities with particular exponents. The behavior of spurious exponents in the presence of noise is also investigated, and found to be different from that of the true exponents. These provide methods for identifying spurious exponents in the analysis of experimental data where the system dynamics may not be known a priori.},

Working in the reconstructed fast-time phase space, phase space warping-based feature vectors are constructed for slow-time damage identification. A subspace of the feature space corresponding to the changes in the operating conditions is identified by applying smooth orthogonal decomposition (SOD) to the initial set of feature vectors. Damage trajectory is then reconstructed by applying SOD to the feature subspace not related to the changes in the operating conditions. The theory is validated experimentally using a vibrating beam, with a variable nonlinear potential field, subjected to fatigue damage. It is shown that the changes in the operating condition (or the potential field) can be successfully separated from the changes caused by damage (or fatigue) accumulation and SOD can identify the slow-time damage trajectory.},

First, we review metrics for functional connectivity, including coherence, phase synchronization, phase-slope index, and Granger causality, with the specific aim to provide an intuition for how these metrics work, as well as their quantitative definition. Next, we highlight a number of interpretational caveats and common pitfalls that can arise when performing functional connectivity analysis, including the common reference problem, the signal to noise ratio problem, the volume conduction problem, the common input problem, and the sample size bias problem. These pitfalls will be illustrated by presenting a set of MATLAB-scripts, which can be executed by the reader to simulate each of these potential problems.

Seventy-six rsFC studies from 70 publications with 2,588 schizophrenia patients and 2,567 healthy controls (HCs) were included in the present meta-analysis. The locations and activation effects of significant intergroup comparisons were extracted and classified based on the ICA templates. Then, multilevel kernel density analysis was used to integrate the results and control bias.Results: Compared with HCs, significant hypoconnectivities were observed between the seed regions and the areas in the auditory network (left insula), core network (right superior temporal cortex), default mode network (right medial prefrontal cortex, and left precuneus and anterior cingulate cortices), self-referential network (right superior temporal cortex), and somatomotor network (right precentral gyrus) in schizophrenia patients. No hyperconnectivity between the seed regions and any other areas within the networks was detected in patients, compared with the connectivity in HCs.Conclusions: Decreased rsFC within the self-referential network and default mode network might play fundamental roles in the malfunction of information processing, while the core network might act as a dysfunctional hub of regulation. Our meta-analysis is consistent with diffuse hypoconnectivities as a dysregulated brain network model of schizophrenia.},

    abstract         = {Abnormal functional brain connectivity could be considered an endophenotype of psychosis in schizophrenia. Identifying candidate endophenotypes may serve as a tool for elucidating its biological and neural mechanisms. The present study investigated the similarities and differences of features of brain network connectivity between patients and their first-degree relatives. Independent component analysis was conducted on imaging data collected from 34 healthy controls, 33 schizophrenia patients, and 30 unaffected first-degree relatives. The correlation between functional connectivity with neurocognitive performance and clinical symptoms were calculated. Abnormalities of between-network connectivity largely overlapped in patients and first-degree relatives, but the extent of such abnormalities was relatively minor in relatives. Negative connectivity between language networks and executive control networks was impaired in schizophrenia patients and their first-degree relatives, and this decreased connectivity was correlated with performance in language processing. Similar impairments were found in high-visual network and executive network coupling, and this decreased connection was correlated with the severity of positive symptoms in patients. The results indicated that abnormal functional connectivity within and between perceptual systems (i.e., high-visual and language) and executive control networks was related to the generic risk of schizophrenia, which makes it a potential endophenotype for schizophrenia.},

    abstract         = {Schizophrenia has often been conceived as a disorder of connectivity between components of large-scale brain networks. We tested this hypothesis by measuring aspects of both functional connectivity and functional network topology derived from resting-state fMRI time series acquired at 72 cerebral regions over 17 min from 15 healthy volunteers (14 male, 1 female) and 12 people diagnosed with schizophrenia (10 male, 2 female). We investigated between-group differences in strength and diversity of functional connectivity in the 0.06-0.125 Hz frequency interval, and some topological properties of undirected graphs constructed from thresholded interregional correlation matrices. In people with schizophrenia, strength of functional connectivity was significantly decreased, whereas diversity of functional connections was increased. Topologically, functional brain networks had reduced clustering and small-worldness, reduced probability of high-degree hubs, and increased robustness in the schizophrenic group. Reduced degree and clustering were locally significant in medial parietal, premotor and cingulate, and right orbitofrontal cortical nodes of functional networks in schizophrenia. Functional connectivity and topological metrics were correlated with each other and with behavioral performance on a verbal fluency task. We conclude that people with schizophrenia tend to have a less strongly integrated, more diverse profile of brain functional connectivity, associated with a less hub-dominated configuration of complex brain functional networks. Alongside these behaviorally disadvantageous differences, however, brain networks in the schizophrenic group also showed a greater robustness to random attack, pointing to a possible benefit of the schizophrenia connectome, if less extremely expressed.},

    abstract         = {We investigated whether functional brain networks are abnormally organized in Alzheimer's disease (AD). To this end, graph theoretical analysis was applied to matrices of functional connectivity of beta band–filtered electroencephalography (EEG) channels, in 15 Alzheimer patients and 13 control subjects. Correlations between all pairwise combinations of EEG channels were determined with the synchronization likelihood. The resulting synchronization matrices were converted to graphs by applying a threshold, and cluster coefficients and path lengths were computed as a function of threshold or as a function of degree K. For a wide range of thresholds, the characteristic path length L was significantly longer in the Alzheimer patients, whereas the cluster coefficient C showed no significant changes. This pattern was still present when L and C were computed as a function of K. A longer path length with a relatively preserved cluster coefficient suggests a loss of complexity and a less optimal organization. The present study provides further support for the presence of “small-world” features in functional brain networks and demonstrates that AD is characterized by a loss of small-world network characteristics. Graph theoretical analysis may be a useful approach to study the complexity of patterns of interrelations between EEG channels.},

    abstract         = {Changes in brain connectivity in patients with early Alzheimer’s disease (AD) have been investigated using graph analysis. However, these studies were based on small data sets, explored a limited range of network parameters, and did not focus on more restricted sub-networks, where neurodegenerative processes may introduce more prominent alterations. In this study, we constructed structural brain networks out of 87 regions using data from 135 healthy elders and 100 early AD patients selected from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) database. We evaluated the graph properties of these networks by investigating metrics of network efficiency, small world properties, segregation, product measures of complexity, and entropy. Because degenerative processes take place at different rates in different brain areas, analysis restricted to sub-networks may reveal changes otherwise undetected. Therefore, we first analyzed the graph properties of a network encompassing all brain areas considered together, and then repeated the analysis after dividing the brain areas into two sub-networks constructed by applying a clustering algorithm. At the level of large scale network, the analysis did not reveal differences between AD patients and controls. In contrast, the same analysis performed on the two sub-networks revealed that small worldness diminished with AD only in the sub-network containing the areas of medial temporal lobe known to be heaviest and earliest affected. The second sub-network, which did not present significant AD-induced modifications of ‘classical’ small world parameters, nonetheless showed a trend towards an increase in small world propensity, a novel metric that unbiasedly quantifies small world structure. Beyond small world properties, complexity and entropy measures indicated that the intricacy of connection patterns and structural diversity decreased in both sub-networks. These results show that neurodegenerative processes impact volumetric networks in a non-global fashion. Our findings provide new quantitative insights into topological principles of structural brain networks and their modifications during early stages of Alzheimer’s disease.},

It was hypothesized that the default mode network would show abnormal activation and connectivity in patients with schizophrenia. Method: Patients with schizophrenia (N=21) and healthy comparison subjects (N=22) performed an auditory oddball task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Independent component analysis was used to identify the default mode component. Differences in the spatial and temporal aspects of the default mode network were examined in patients versus comparison subjects. Results: Healthy comparison subjects and patients had significant spatial differences in the default mode network, most notably in the frontal, anterior cingulate, and parahippocampal gyri. In addition, activity in patients in the medial frontal, temporal, and cingulate gyri correlated with severity of positive symptoms. The patients also showed significantly higher frequency fluctuations in the temporal evolution of the default mode. Conclusions: Schizophrenia is associated with altered temporal frequency and spatial location of the default mode network. The authors hypothesized that this network may be under- or overmodulated by key regions, including the anterior and posterior cingulate cortex. In addition, the altered temporal fluctuations in patients may result from a change in the connectivity of these regions with other brain networks.},

Neuroimaging studies of sleep based on EEG–PET and EEG–fMRI are revealing the brain networks that support sleep, as well as networks that may support the roles and processes attributed to sleep. For example, phenomena such as arousal and consciousness are substantially modulated during sleep, and one would expect this modulation to be reflected in altered network activity. In addition, recent work suggests that sleep also has a number of adaptive functions that support waking activity. Thus the study of sleep may elucidate the circuits and processes that support waking function and complement information obtained from fMRI during waking conditions. In this review, we will discuss examples of this for memory, arousal, and consciousness after providing a brief background on sleep and on studying it with fMRI.},

This finding led to the hypothesis that these regions constitute a network supporting a default mode of brain function. In this study, we investigate three questions pertaining to this hypothesis: Does such a resting-state network exist in the human brain? Is it modulated during simple sensory processing? How is it modulated during cognitive processing? To address these questions, we defined PCC and vACC regions that showed decreased activity during a cognitive (working memory) task, then examined their functional connectivity during rest. PCC was strongly coupled with vACC and several other brain regions implicated in the default mode network. Next, we examined the functional connectivity of PCC and vACC during a visual processing task and show that the resultant connectivity maps are virtually identical to those obtained during rest. Last, we defined three lateral prefrontal regions showing increased activity during the cognitive task and examined their resting-state connectivity. We report significant inverse correlations among all three lateral prefrontal regions and PCC, suggesting a mechanism for attenuation of default mode network activity during cognitive processing. This study constitutes, to our knowledge, the first resting-state connectivity analysis of the default mode and provides the most compelling evidence to date for the existence of a cohesive default mode network. Our findings also provide insight into how this network is modulated by task demands and what functions it might subserve.},

We introduce a new method for characterizing inter-regional interactions using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. This method's principle advantage over existing analytical techniques is its ability to model the functional connectivity between brain regions during distinct stages of a cognitive task. The method is implemented by using separate covariates to model the activity evoked during each stage of each individual trial in the context of the general linear model (GLM). The resulting parameter estimates (beta values) are sorted according to the stage from which they were derived to form a set of stage-specific beta series. Regions whose beta series are correlated during a given stage are inferred to be functionally interacting during that stage. To validate the assumption that correlated fluctuations in trial-to-trial beta values imply functional connectivity, we applied the method to an event-related fMRI data set in which subjects performed two sequence-tapping tasks. In concordance with previous electrophysiological and fMRI coherence studies, we found that the task requiring greater bimanual coordination induced stronger correlations between motor regions of the two hemispheres. The method was then applied to an event-related fMRI data set in which subjects performed a delayed recognition task. Distinct functional connectivity maps were generated during the component stages of this task, illustrating how important and novel observations of neural networks within the isolated stages of a cognitive task can be obtained.},

    abstract         = {It has been shown recently that a significant portion of brain electrical field potentials consists of scale-free dynamics. These scale-free brain dynamics contain complex spatiotemporal structures and are modulated by task performance. Here we show that the fMRI signal recorded from the human brain is also scale free; its power-law exponent differentiates between brain networks and correlates with fMRI signal variance and brain glucose metabolism. Importantly, in parallel to brain electrical field potentials, the variance and power-law exponent of the fMRI signal decrease during task activation, suggesting that the signal contains more long-range memory during rest and conversely is more efficient at online information processing during task. Remarkably, similar changes also occurred in task-deactivated brain regions, revealing the presence of an optimal dynamic range in the fMRI signal. The scale-free properties of the fMRI signal and brain electrical field potentials bespeak their respective stationarity and nonstationarity. This suggests that neurovascular coupling mechanism is likely to contain a transformation from nonstationarity to stationarity. In summary, our results demonstrate the functional relevance of scale-free properties of the fMRI signal and impose constraints on future models of neurovascular coupling.},

These respiratory fluctuations are a type of amplitude and frequency modulation of the instantaneous lung volume. Consequently, the respiratory signal itself has little spectral content at the modulation frequency, whereas a nonlinear transformation of the signal, such as the envelope formed by its inspiratory and expiratory peaks, has a clear spectral peak at the modulation frequency. The authors propose three possible mechanisms for this nonlinear relationship between respiration and heart rate. One is based on a classical feedback and control model of regulatory physiology; one considers the effect of forcing a Van der Pol oscillator with a low-frequency sine wave; and one considers the interactions between two simple nonlinear oscillators whose intrinsic frequencies are near the primary respiratory frequency.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

The resulting “BVP model” has two variables of state, representing excitability and refractoriness, and qualitatively resembles Bonhoeffer's theoretical model for the iron wire model of nerve. This BVP model serves as a simple representative of a class of excitable-oscillatory systems including the Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model of the squid giant axon. The BVP phase plane can be divided into regions corresponding to the physiological states of nerve fiber (resting, active, refractory, enhanced, depressed, etc.) to form a “physiological state diagram,” with the help of which many physiological phenomena can be summarized. A properly chosen projection from the 4-dimensional HH phase space onto a plane produces a similar diagram which shows the underlying relationship between the two models. Impulse trains occur in the BVP and HH models for a range of constant applied currents which make the singular point representing the resting state unstable.},

The primary physical manifestations of inflammation are redness, swelling, heat, pain, and loss of function to the affected area. These processes involve the major cells of the immune system, including monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, basophils, dendritic cells, mast cells, T-cells, and B-cells. However, examination of a range of inflammatory lesions demonstrates the presence of specific leukocytes in any given lesion. That is, the inflammatory process is regulated in such a way as to ensure that the appropriate leukocytes are recruited. These events are in turn controlled by a host of extracellular molecular regulators, including members of the cytokine and chemokine families that mediate both immune cell recruitment and complex intracellular signalling control mechanisms that characterise inflammation. This review will focus on the role of the main cytokines, chemokines, and their receptors in the pathophysiology of auto-inflammatory disorders, pro-inflammatory disorders, and neurological disorders involving inflammation.},

As mapping and recording techniques become increasingly capable of capturing neural structure and activity across widely distributed circuits and systems, there is a growing need for new analysis tools and modeling approaches to make sense of these rich “big data” sets. Modern network science offers a way forward. Both structural and functional brain data sets can be rendered in the form of complex networks and thus become amenable for network modeling and analysis, which can be carried out across scales, from the micro-scale of individual neurons to the macro-scale of whole-brain recordings. In this article, I sketch an overview of structural and functional brain network studies ranging from cells to systems. My emphasis will be on common themes in mapping network attributes across scales. In addition to highlighting important advances, I will outline some major challenges that need to be overcome to achieve a more complete understanding of connectome networks.},

    abstract         = {The cortex is a complex system, characterized by its dynamics and architecture, which underlie many functions such as action, perception, learning, language, and cognition. Its structural architecture has been studied for more than a hundred years; however, its dynamics have been addressed much less thoroughly. In this paper, we review and integrate, in a unifying framework, a variety of computational approaches that have been used to characterize the dynamics of the cortex, as evidenced at different levels of measurement. Computational models at different space–time scales help us understand the fundamental mechanisms that underpin neural processes and relate these processes to neuroscience data. Modeling at the single neuron level is necessary because this is the level at which information is exchanged between the computing elements of the brain; the neurons. Mesoscopic models tell us how neural elements interact to yield emergent behavior at the level of microcolumns and cortical columns. Macroscopic models can inform us about whole brain dynamics and interactions between large-scale neural systems such as cortical regions, the thalamus, and brain stem. Each level of description relates uniquely to neuroscience data, from single-unit recordings, through local field potentials to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalogram (EEG), and magnetoencephalogram (MEG). Models of the cortex can establish which types of large-scale neuronal networks can perform computations and characterize their emergent properties. Mean-field and related formulations of dynamics also play an essential and complementary role as forward models that can be inverted given empirical data. This makes dynamic models critical in integrating theory and experiments. We argue that elaborating principled and informed models is a prerequisite for grounding empirical neuroscience in a cogent theoretical framework, commensurate with the achievements in the physical sciences.},

Each area contains a distinct visuotopic representation and encodes a unique combination of spatiotemporal features. Areas LM, AL, RL, and AM prefer up to three times faster temporal frequencies and significantly lower spatial frequencies than V1, while V1 and PM prefer high spatial and low temporal frequencies. LI prefers both high spatial and temporal frequencies. All extrastriate areas except LI increase orientation selectivity compared to V1, and three areas are significantly more direction selective (AL, RL, AM). Specific combinations of spatiotemporal representations further distinguish areas. These results reveal that mouse higher visual areas are functionally distinct, and separate groups of areas may be specialized for motion-related versus pattern-related computations perhaps forming pathways analogous to dorsal and ventral streams in other species.},

    abstract         = {Chaos, or exponential sensitivity to small perturbations, appears everywhere in nature. Moreover, chaos is predicted to play diverse functional roles in living systems. A method for detecting chaos from empirical measurements should therefore be a key component of the biologist’s toolkit. But, classic chaos-detection tools are highly sensitive to measurement noise and break down for common edge cases, making it difficult to detect chaos in domains, like biology, where measurements are noisy. However, newer tools promise to overcome these limitations. Here, we combine several such tools into an automated processing pipeline, and show that our pipeline can detect the presence (or absence) of chaos in noisy recordings, even for difficult edge cases. As a first-pass application of our pipeline, we show that heart rate variability is not chaotic as some have proposed, and instead reflects a stochastic process in both health and disease. Our tool is easy-to-use and freely available.},

This conjecture is based on the power spectrum behavior of the excitation energy fluctuations, which is different for chaotic and integrable systems. Using random matrix theory, we derive theoretical expressions that explain without free parameters the universal behavior of the excitation energy fluctuations power spectrum. The theory gives excellent agreement with numerical calculations and reproduces to a good approximation the 1/f (1/f2) power law characteristic of chaotic (integrable) systems. Moreover, the theoretical results are valid for semiclassical systems as well.},

    abstract         = {Cancer progression is commonly accompanied by an altered glucose metabolism. In general, spatially resolved imaging of glucose metabolism and its subtle alterations might provide valuable diagnostic information in vivo. A classical example is positron emission tomography that exploits this feature in obtaining preferential accumulation of fluorescent analog of glucose in tumors, thereby achieving an imaging contrast. We report a novel scaling analysis of glucose metabolism in mammary epithelial (NMuMG) cells by detrended fluctuation analysis of Cerulean (cyan fluorescent protein variant) fluorescence. Fluorescence fluctuations of Cerulean are reasoned to be indicative of dynamic pH changes associated with glucose metabolism. Normal parental cells and the spontaneously transformed (cancerous) NMuMG cells displayed robust scaling exponent that reflects nonrandom fluctuations in Cerulean fluorescence. Acute dependence of cancer cells on glycolysis as compared with normal cells is exploited to yield a statistically significant difference in scaling exponent, thereby providing discrimination between normal and cancer cells in vitro. By careful design of experiments in vivo, the proposed scaling approach might even have diagnostic potential for early detection of cancer lesions in small animal models.},

Machine learning and deep learning techniques have proven to be broadly applicable in various scientific research areas. We aim to exploit some of these methods to improve the conventional algorithm based approaches presently used in astrophysics to detect exoplanets. Using the time-series analysis library TSFresh to analyse light curves, we extracted 789 features from each curve, which capture the information about the characteristics of a light curve. We then used these features to train a gradient boosting classifier using the machine learning tool lightgbm. This approach was tested on simulated data, which showed that is more effective than the conventional box least squares fitting (BLS) method. We further found that our method produced comparable results to existing state-of-the-art deep learning models, while being much more computationally efficient and without needing folded and secondary views of the light curves. For Kepler data, the method is able to predict a planet with an AUC of 0.948, so that 94.8 per cent of the true planet signals are ranked higher than non-planet signals. The resulting recall is 0.96, so that 96 per cent of real planets are classified as planets. For the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) data, we found our method can classify light curves with an accuracy of 0.98, and is able to identify planets with a recall of 0.82 at a precision of 0.63.},

By this technique, changes in the optical absorption of light are recorded over time and are used to estimate the functionally evoked changes in cerebral oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin concentrations that result from local cerebral vascular and oxygen metabolic effects during brain activity. Over the past three decades this technology has continued to grow, and today NIRS studies have found many niche applications in the fields of psychology, physiology, and cerebral pathology. The growing popularity of this technique is in part associated with a lower cost and increased portability of NIRS equipment when compared with other imaging modalities, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography. With this increasing number of applications, new techniques for the processing, analysis, and interpretation of NIRS data are continually being developed. We review some of the time-series and functional analysis techniques that are currently used in NIRS studies, we describe the practical implementation of various signal processing techniques for removing physiological, instrumental, and motion-artifact noise from optical data, and we discuss the unique aspects of NIRS analysis in comparison with other brain imaging modalities. These methods are described within the context of the MATLAB-based graphical user interface program, HomER, which we have developed and distributed to facilitate the processing of optical functional brain data.},

Interestingly, recent advances in the acquisition and analysis of functional neuroimaging data have catalyzed the exploration of functional connectivity in the human brain. Functional connectivity is defined as the temporal dependency of neuronal activation patterns of anatomically separated brain regions and in the past years an increasing body of neuroimaging studies has started to explore functional connectivity by measuring the level of co-activation of resting-state fMRI time-series between brain regions. These studies have revealed interesting new findings about the functional connections of specific brain regions and local networks, as well as important new insights in the overall organization of functional communication in the brain network. Here we present an overview of these new methods and discuss how they have led to new insights in core aspects of the human brain, providing an overview of these novel imaging techniques and their implication to neuroscience. We discuss the use of spontaneous resting-state fMRI in determining functional connectivity, discuss suggested origins of these signals, how functional connections tend to be related to structural connections in the brain network and how functional brain communication may form a key role in cognitive performance. Furthermore, we will discuss the upcoming field of examining functional connectivity patterns using graph theory, focusing on the overall organization of the functional brain network. Specifically, we will discuss the value of these new functional connectivity tools in examining believed connectivity diseases, like Alzheimer's disease, dementia, schizophrenia and multiple sclerosis.},

In this review we describe the connections between time series analysis and nonlinear dynamics, discuss signal-to-noise enhancement, and present some of the novel methods for spectral analysis. The various steps, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of these methods, are illustrated by their application to an important climatic time series, the Southern Oscillation Index.

    abstract         = {Vegetation dynamics and phenology play an important role in inter-annual vegetation changes in terrestrial ecosystems and are key indicators of climate-vegetation interactions, land use/land cover changes and variation in year-to-year vegetation productivity. Satellite remote sensing data have been widely used for vegetation phenology monitoring over large geographic domains using various types of observations and methods over the past several decades. The goal of this paper is to present a detailed review of existing methods for phenology detection and emerging new techniques based on the analysis of time-series, multispectral remote sensing imagery. This paper summarizes the objective and applications of detecting general vegetation phenology stages (e.g., green onset, time or peak greenness and growing season length) often termed ‘land surface phenology’, as well as more advanced methods that estimate species-specific phenological stages (e.g., silking stage of maize). Common data processing methods, such as data smoothing, applied to prepare the time-series remote sensing observations to be applied to phenological detection methods are presented. Specific land surface phenology detection methods as well as species-specific phenology detection methods based on multispectral satellite data are then discussed. The impact of different error sources in the data on remote-sensing based phenology detection are also discussed in detail, as well as ways to reduce these uncertainties and errors. Joint analysis of multi-scale observations ranging from satellite to more recent ground-based sensors is helpful for us to understand satellite-based phenology detection mechanism and extent phenology detection to regional scale in the future. Finally, emerging opportunities to further advance remote sensing of phenology is presented that includes observations from Cubesats, near-surface observations such as PhenoCams and image data fusion techniques to improve the spatial resolution of time-series image data sets needed for phenological characterization.},

    abstract         = {In the absence of annual laminations, time series generated from lake sediments or other similar stratigraphic sequences are irregularly spaced in time, which complicates formal analysis using classical statistical time series models. In lieu, statistical analyses of trends in palaeoenvironmental time series, if done at all, have typically used simpler linear regressions or (non-) parametric correlations with little regard for the violation of assumptions that almost surely occurs due to temporal dependencies in the data or that correlations do not provide estimates of the magnitude of change, just whether or not there is a linear or monotonic trend. Alternative approaches have used Loess-estimated trends to justify data interpretations or test hypotheses as to the causal factors without considering the inherent subjectivity of the choice of parameters used to achieve the Loess fit (e.g., span width, degree of polynomial). Generalised additive models (GAMs) are statistical models that can be used to estimate trends as smooth functions of time. Unlike Loess, GAMs use automatic smoothness selection methods to objectively determine the complexity of the fitted trend, and as formal statistical models, GAMs, allow for potentially complex, non-linear trends, a proper accounting of model uncertainty, and the identification of periods of significant temporal change. Here, I present a consistent and modern approach to the estimation of trends in palaeoenvironmental time series using GAMs, illustrating features of the methodology with two example time series of contrasting complexity; a 150-year bulk organic matter d15N time series from Small Water, UK, and a 3,000-year alkenone record from Braya-Sø, Greenland. I discuss the underlying mechanics of GAMs that allow them to learn the shape of the trend from the data themselves and how simultaneous confidence intervals and the first derivatives of the trend are used to properly account for model uncertainty and identify periods of change. It is hoped that by using GAMs greater attention is paid to the statistical estimation of trends in palaeoenvironmental time series leading to more a robust and reproducible palaeoscience.},

    abstract         = {We report on the analysis of experiments on a neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet laser with an intracavity frequency-doubling crystal. Three modes of the laser were excited in differing polarization configurations. The total intensity of infrared light was observed and then analyzed using methods of nonlinear-time-series analysis. We present clear evidence using global false nearest neighbors that when all polarizations are parallel, the intensity is chaotic with two positive Lyapunov exponents and the system can be embedded in dimension 7. The noise level in this operating condition, which we call type I chaos, is small. When one of the polarizations is perpendicular to the others, the intensity is again chaotic with positive Lyapunov exponents, but there is substantial noise in the signal of high dimensional origin, and no finite embedding dimension appears possible. We call this type II chaos. We suggest that the origin of this phenomenon is the intrinsic quantum noise associated with the generation of green light, which is 25 times more intense in the type II operating configuration than in the first. In past experiments with this system we have found that the type I chaos can be controlled to unstable periodic orbits while type II cannot. In each type of chaotic laser operation we use local false nearest neighbors to demonstrate that the local dimension of the dynamics is 7. This means seven differential equations can capture the full dynamics of these regimes of the laser. We evaluate local and global false nearest neighbors to support our conclusions and determine the Lyapunov spectrum of each type of chaotic behavior. The predictability of type II chaos is shown to be much less than that of type I, and we make local polynomial models in reconstructed-state space to demonstrate that we can predict rather well for type I chaos. Finally we suggest a fairly standard model for the interaction of the infrared light with the nonlinear frequency doubling medium and with a two-level of the active medium. © 1996 The American Physical Society.},

The cavity offers readout of both linear-in-position and quadratic-in-position (nonlinear) light-matter coupling, while simultaneously cooling the nanosphere, for indefinite periods of time and in high vacuum. We observe the cooling dynamics via both linear and nonlinear coupling.

In previous experiments, the output was uncoupled from the system and, in most cases, simply computed off-line on a postprocessing computer. However, numerical investigations have shown that feeding the output back into the reservoir opens the possibility of long-horizon time-series forecasting. Here, we present a photonic reservoir computer with output feedback, and we demonstrate its capacity to generate periodic time series and to emulate chaotic systems. We study in detail the effect of experimental noise on system performance. In the case of chaotic systems, we introduce several metrics, based on standard signal-processing techniques, to evaluate the quality of the emulation. Our work significantly enlarges the range of tasks that can be solved by hardware reservoir computers and, therefore, the range of applications they could potentially tackle.

    abstract         = {The combination of the compactness of networks, featuring small diameters, and their complex architectures results in a variety of critical effects dramatically different from those in cooperative systems on lattices. In the last few years, important steps have been made toward understanding the qualitatively new critical phenomena in complex networks. The results, concepts, and methods of this rapidly developing field are reviewed. Two closely related classes of these critical phenomena are considered, namely, structural phase transitions in the network architectures and transitions in cooperative models on networks as substrates. Systems where a network and interacting agents on it influence each other are also discussed. A wide range of critical phenomena in equilibrium and growing networks including the birth of the giant connected component, percolation, k-core percolation, phenomena near epidemic thresholds, condensation transitions, critical phenomena in spin models placed on networks, synchronization, and self-organized criticality effects in interacting systems on networks are mentioned. Strong finite-size effects in these systems and open problems and perspectives are also discussed.},

    abstract         = {Complex (dusty) plasmas are composed of a weakly ionized gas and charged microparticles and represent the plasma state of soft matter. Complex plasmas have several remarkable features: Dynamical time scales associated with microparticles are “stretched” to tens of milliseconds, yet the microparticles themselves can be easily visualized individually. Furthermore, since the background gas is dilute, the particle dynamics in strongly coupled complex plasmas is virtually undamped, which provides a direct analogy to regular liquids and solids in terms of the atomistic dynamics. Finally, complex plasmas can be easily manipulated in different ways—also at the level of individual particles. Altogether, this gives us a unique opportunity to go beyond the limits of continuous media and study—at the kinetic level—various generic processes occurring in liquids or solids, in regimes ranging from the onset of cooperative phenomena to large strongly coupled systems. In the first part of the review some of the basic and new physics are highlighted which complex plasmas enable us to study, and in the second (major) part strong coupling phenomena in an interdisciplinary context are examined. The connections with complex fluids are emphasized and a number of generic liquid and solid-state issues are addressed. In summary, application oriented research is discussed.},

    abstract         = {Analog machine learning hardware platforms promise to be faster and more energy efficient than their digital counterparts. Wave physics, as found in acoustics and optics, is a natural candidate for building analog processors for time-varying signals. Here, we identify a mapping between the dynamics of wave physics and the computation in recurrent neural networks. This mapping indicates that physical wave systems can be trained to learn complex features in temporal data, using standard training techniques for neural networks. As a demonstration, we show that an inverse-designed inhomogeneous medium can perform vowel classification on raw audio signals as their waveforms scatter and propagate through it, achieving performance comparable to a standard digital implementation of a recurrent neural network. These findings pave the way for a new class of analog machine learning platforms, capable of fast and efficient processing of information in its native domain. Analog machine learning computations are performed passively by propagating light and sound waves through programmed materials.

    abstract         = {Accurate prediction of building’s response subjected to earthquakes makes possible to evaluate building performance. To this end, we leverage the recent advances in deep learning and develop a physics-guided convolutional neural network (PhyCNN) for data-driven structural seismic response modeling. The concept is to train a deep PhyCNN model based on limited seismic input–output datasets (e.g., from simulation or sensing) and physics constraints, and thus establish a surrogate model for structural response prediction. Available physics (e.g., the law of dynamics) can provide constraints to the network outputs, alleviate overfitting issues, reduce the need of big training datasets, and thus improve the robustness of the trained model for more reliable prediction. The surrogate model is then utilized for fragility analysis given certain limit state criteria. In addition, an unsupervised learning algorithm based on K-means clustering is also proposed to partition the datasets to training, validation and prediction categories, so as to maximize the use of limited datasets. The performance of PhyCNN is demonstrated through both numerical and experimental examples. Convincing results illustrate that PhyCNN is capable of accurately predicting building’s seismic response in a data-driven fashion without the need of a physics-based analytical/numerical model. The PhyCNN paradigm also outperforms non-physics-guided neural networks.},

Encoding models typically comprise a nonlinear transformation of stimuli to features (feature model) and a linear convolution of features to responses (response model). While there has been extensive work on developing better feature models, the work on developing better response models has been rather limited. Here, we investigate the extent to which recurrent neural network models can use their internal memories for nonlinear processing of arbitrary feature sequences to predict feature-evoked response sequences as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging. We show that the proposed recurrent neural network models can significantly outperform established response models by accurately estimating long-term dependencies that drive hemodynamic responses.

A number of biological and ecological examples are used to illustrate the concepts and modeling techniques across a wide range of systems, from gene regulatory networks to ant colonies to food webs. The examples cover collective behaviors, information cascades, optimal path formation, stigmergy, predator–prey interactions, and tipping points in climate and ecosystems. Three information-processing components (memory, communications, and modifications) are placed in the context of system ecology, drawing parallels with ecological memory, ecological interactions and ecological modifications. The entry concludes with a comparison between complex and complicated systems, drawing a distinction in the ways that adaptive and engineered systems achieve stability in the face of external perturbations.},

First, it presents a brief exploration of the Earth's climate system through the lens of complexity science. Then, it introduces the data sources and modeling strategies that climate science uses to understand past behavior, to fingerprint causes of current climate changes, and to project future climate. The complex dynamics of the climate system constrain ability to gain knowledge about the climate system and add uncertainty to predictions of the impacts of human-induced climate change. It also investigates six case studies that illustrate the importance and development of key complexity themes in climate science: glacial-interglacial cycles, thermohaline ocean circulation, ice sheets, vegetation cover changes, extinction, and overshoot scenarios. In addition, it investigates the implications of the complexity of the Earth system for climate policy analysis. Assessments of the impacts of climate change are often disciplinary-based and not sufficiently integrative across important disciplinary subcomponents, producing misleading results that have potentially dangerous environmental consequences. The current framework of cost-benefit optimization is particularly flawed. Further, it describes how one should restructure climate policy analysis as an integrated assessment process, combining data and relationships from the physical, biological and social sciences, that includes robust assessments of potential risks within a vulnerability framework.},

We highlight these features of ecological complexity—such as diversity, cross-scale interactions, memory and environmental variability—that continue to challenge classical complex systems science.

    abstract         = {In the era of big data, all types of data with increasing samples and high-dimensional attributes are demonstrating their important roles in various fields, such as data mining, pattern recognition and machine learning, etc. Meanwhile, machine learning algorithms are being effectively applied in large-scale data processing. This paper mainly reviews the classical dimensionality reduction and sample selection methods based on machine learning algorithms for large-scale data processing. Firstly, the paper provides a brief overview to the classical sample selection and dimensionality reduction methods. Then, it pays attention to the applications of those methods and their combinations with the classical machine learning methods, such as clustering, random forest, fuzzy set, and heuristic algorithms, particularly deep leaning methods. Furthermore, the paper primarily introduces the application frameworks that combine sample selection and dimensionality reduction in the context of two aspects: sequential and simultaneous, which almost all get the ideal results in the processing of the large-scale training data contrasting to the original models. Lastly, we further conclude that sample selection and dimensionality reduction methods are essential and effective for the modern large-scale data processing. In the future work, the machine learning algorithms, especially the deep learning methods, will play a more important role in the processing of large-scale data.},

    abstract         = {Neuronal basis of lethargy in worms How does the brain switch between wakefulness and sleep? Nichols et al. studied this question using brain-wide Ca2+ imaging at single-neuron resolution in nematodes. By changing O2 concentrations, they could rapidly switch the worms between behaviorally quiescent and active states. They observed a global quiescence brain state characterized by the systemic down-regulation of neuronal network dynamics. Signaling from O2 sensory neurons rapidly evoked and maintained active network dynamics. Conversely, in the absence of such arousing cues, network dynamics converged into the quiescent mode. Science, this issue p. eaam6851 Structured Abstract INTRODUCTIONGlobal brain states such as sleep and wakefulness involve reconfigurations of neural circuit activity across the entire nervous system. Yet it is not understood how the brain can effectively switch between and maintain different states. Do dedicated brain centers control states via top-down mechanisms? And to what extent do self-organizing principles of neuronal networks play a role? To address these questions, it would be ideal to measure the contributions of all individual neurons to a global brain state. Unfortunately, this is currently not possible in mammals or other large organisms. Every animal thoroughly studied exhibits sleeplike behaviors, implying that sleep is an essential, primordial, and common function of neural networks. In mammals, sleep is defined at the physiological level by a characteristic electroencephalography (EEG) signal. Such a definition is missing for invertebrate models, which primarily rely on behavioral definitions. RATIONALEThe nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a tractable model organism with the potential to overcome these limitations: It has a stereotypic and mapped nervous system of only 302 neurons. Sleep is developmentally timed and occurs predominantly during lethargus periods of {\textasciitilde}2 hours at the end of each larval stage. During wakefulness, the worm brain exhibits neuronal population dynamics that involve a large fraction ({\textasciitilde}40\%) of neurons. These neuronal activities are highly coordinated across the neuronal population;},

By first using PCA to identify clusters within the vectors of fMRI time series, more energy and information features in the signal can be maintained than using averaged values from brain regions of interest. Then, regression analysis can be applied to the extracted principal components in order to further investigate functional connectivity. Finally, t-test is applied and the patterns with t-values lager than a threshold are considered as functional connectivity mappings. The validity and reliability of the presented method were demonstrated with both simulated data and human fMRI data obtained during behavioral task and resting state. Compared to the conventional functional connectivity methods such as average signal based correlation analysis, independent component analysis (ICA) and PCA, the proposed method achieves competitive performance with greater accuracy and true positive rate (TPR). Furthermore, the 'default mode' and motor network results of resting-state fMRI data indicate that using PCA may improve upon application of existing regression analysis methods in study of human brain functional connectivity.},

The techniques of functional data analysis are used to carry out PCA directly on these functions. We show that functional PCA is more effective than is its ordinary counterpart in recovering the signal of interest, even if limited or no prior knowledge of the form of hemodynamic function or the structure of the experimental design is specified.

The book presents key concepts, methods, examples, and applications, as well as chapters on feature engineering for major data types such as texts, images, sequences, time series, graphs, streaming data, software engineering data, Twitter data, and social media data. It also contains generic feature generation approaches, as well as methods for generating tried-and-tested, hand-crafted, domain-specific features. The first chapter defines the concepts of features and feature engineering, offers an overview of the book, and provides pointers to topics not covered in this book. The next six chapters are devoted to feature engineering, including feature generation for specific data types. The subsequent four chapters cover generic approaches for feature engineering, namely feature selection, feature transformation based feature engineering, deep learning based feature engineering, and pattern based feature generation and engineering. The last three chapters discuss feature engineering for social bot detection, software management, and Twitter-based applications respectively. This book can be used as a reference for data analysts, big data scientists, data preprocessing workers, project managers, project developers, prediction modelers, professors, researchers, graduate students, and upper level undergraduate students. It can also be used as the primary text for courses on feature engineering, or as a supplement for courses on machine learning, data mining, and big data analytics.},

    abstract         = {Most complex systems are intrinsically dynamic in nature. The evolution of a dynamic complex system is typically represented as a sequence of snapshots, where each snapshot describes the configuration of the system at a particular instant of time. This is often done by using constant intervals but a better approach would be to define dynamic intervals that match the evolution of the system’s configuration. To this end, we propose a method that aims at detecting evolutionary changes in the configuration of a complex system, and generates intervals accordingly. We show that evolutionary timescales can be identified by looking for peaks in the similarity between the sets of events on consecutive time intervals of data. Tests on simple toy models reveal that the technique is able to detect evolutionary timescales of time-varying data both when the evolution is smooth as well as when it changes sharply. This is further corroborated by analyses of several real datasets. Our method is scalable to extremely large datasets and is computationally efficient. This allows a quick, parameter-free detection of multiple timescales in the evolution of a complex system.},

Spectral analysis using the Fourier Transform is a powerful technique for stationary time series where the characteristics of the signal do not change with time. For non-stationary time series like modulated signals, the spectral content changes with time and hence time-averaged amplitude spectrum found by using Fourier Transform is inadequate to track the changes in the signal magnitude, frequency or phase. The FSWT is an extension of short time Fourier Transform in the frequency domain and is based on a moving and scalable localizing modified Gaussian window. This transform has some desirable characteristics that are absent in the earlier wavelet transform. The Frequency Slice Wavelet Transform is unique in that it provides frequency - dependant resolution while maintaining a direct relationship with the Fourier spectrum. Several non-stationary synthetic and practical power signals are taken for analysis using both frequency slice wavelet transform and wavelet transforms to prove the superiority of the former over the later.},

    abstract         = {Non-stationary time series (TS) analysis has gained an explosive interest over the recent decades in different applied sciences. In fact, several decomposition methods were developed in order to extract various components (e.g., seasonal, trend and abrupt components) from the non-stationary TS, which allows for an improved interpretation of the temporal variability. The wavelet transform (WT) has been successfully applied over an extraordinary range of fields in order to decompose the non-stationary TS into time-frequency domain. For this reason, the WT method is briefly introduced and reviewed in this paper. In addition, this latter includes different research and applications of the WT to non-stationary TS in seven different applied sciences fields, namely the geo-sciences and geophysics, remote sensing in vegetation analysis, engineering, hydrology, finance, medicine, and other fields, such as ecology, renewable energy, chemistry and history. Finally, five challenges and future works, such as the selection of the type of wavelet, selection of the adequate mother wavelet, selection of the scale, the combination between wavelet transform and machine learning algorithm and the interpretation of the obtained components, are also discussed.},

The TVPDM, by design, reduces one dimension, and by projecting PDM coefficients onto a set of basis functions, both nonstationary and nonlinear dynamics can be characterized. Another significant advantage of the TVPDM is its ability to discriminate the signal from noise dynamics, and provided that signal dynamics are orthogonal to each other, it has the capability to separate them. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated with computer simulation examples comprised of various forms of nonstationarity and nonlinearity. The application of the TVPDM to the human heart rate and arterial blood pressure data during different postures is also presented and the results reveal significant nonstationarity even for short-term data recordings. The newly developed method has the potential to be a very useful tool for characterizing nonlinear TV systems, which has been a significant, challenging problem to date.},

Initial studies assumed this resting-state functional connectivity (FC) to be stationary in nature, but recent studies have modeled these activities as a dynamic network. Dynamic spatiotemporal models better model the brain activities, but are computationally more involved. A comparison of static and dynamic FCs was made to quantitatively study their efficacies in identifying intrinsic individual connectivity patterns using data from the Human Connectome Project. Results show that the intrinsic individual brain connectivity pattern can be used as a ‘fingerprint’ to distinguish among and identify subjects and is more accurately captured with partial correlation and assuming static FC. It was also seen that the intrinsic individual brain connectivity patterns were invariant over a few months. Additionally, biological sex identification was successfully performed using the intrinsic individual connectivity patterns, and group averages of male and female FC matrices. Edge consistency, edge variability and differential power measures were used to identify the major resting-state networks involved in identifying subjects and their sex.},

Conclusions from previous resting-state fMRI investigations were based upon static descriptions of functional connectivity (FC), and only recently studies have begun to capitalize on the wealth of information contained within the temporal features of spontaneous BOLD FC. Emerging evidence suggests that dynamic FC metrics may index changes in macroscopic neural activity patterns underlying critical aspects of cognition and behavior, though limitations with regard to analysis and interpretation remain.

Pattern analysis methods now offer a principled way for constructing such network hierarchies.

Recent work has demonstrated that static, i.e. time-invariant resting-state and task-based FC predicts individual differences in behavior, including attention. Here, we show that DFC predicts attention performance across individuals. Sliding-window FC matrices were generated from fMRI data collected during rest and attention task performance by calculating Pearson's r between every pair of nodes of a whole-brain atlas within overlapping 10-60s time segments. Next, variance in r values across windows was taken to quantify temporal variability in the strength of each connection, resulting in a DFC connectome for each individual. In a leave-one-subject-out-cross-validation approach, partial-least-square-regression (PLSR) models were then trained to predict attention task performance from DFC matrices. Predicted and observed attention scores were significantly correlated, indicating successful out-of-sample predictions across rest and task conditions. Combining DFC and static FC features numerically improves predictions over either model alone, but the improvement was not statistically significant. Moreover, dynamic and combined models generalized to two independent data sets (participants performing the Attention Network Task and the stop-signal task). Edges with significant PLSR coefficients concentrated in visual, motor, and executive-control brain networks; moreover, most of these coefficients were negative. Thus, better attention may rely on more stable, i.e. less variable, information flow between brain regions.},

Our exploration commences with the conjecture of a small-world patterning, present in the scalp topography of the measured electrical activity. The existence of such a communication pattern is first confirmed for our data and then precisely determined by means of two distinct measures of non-linear interdependence between time-series. A graph encapsulating the small-world network structure along with the relative interdependence strength is formed for each sleep stage and subsequently fed to a suitable clustering procedure. Finally the delineated graph components are comparatively presented for all stages revealing novel attributes of sleep architecture. Our results suggest a pivotal role for the functional coupling during the different stages and indicate interesting dynamic characteristics like its variable hemispheric asymmetry and the isolation between anterior and posterior cortical areas during REM.},

We used an automated pulsation classification algorithm to find 93 new δ Scuti pulsators among tens of thousands of F-type stars, which we then searched for phase modulation attributable to binarity.

This trend has resulted in a strong uptake in the use of (Shannon) information-theoretic measures to analyze the dynamics of complex systems in these fields. We introduce the Java Information Dynamics Toolkit (JIDT): a Google code project, which provides a standalone (GNU GPL v3 licensed) open-source code implementation for empirical estimation of information-theoretic measures from time-series data. While the toolkit provides classic information-theoretic measures (e.g., entropy, mutual information, and conditional mutual information), it ultimately focuses on implementing higher-level measures for information dynamics. That is, JIDT focuses on quantifying information storage, transfer, and modification, and the dynamics of these operations in space and time. For this purpose, it includes implementations of the transfer entropy and active information storage, their multivariate extensions and local or pointwise variants. JIDT provides implementations for both discrete and continuous-valued data for each measure, including various types of estimator for continuous data (e.g., Gaussian, box-kernel, and Kraskov–Stögbauer–Grassberger), which can be swapped at run-time due to Java’s object-oriented polymorphism. Furthermore, while written in Java, the toolkit can be used directly in MATLAB, GNU Octave, Python, and other environments. We present the principles behind the code design, and provide several examples to guide users.},

Masers are influenced by the first two types of noise, and probably also by the third. The influence of these sources of noise on frequency fluctuation vs. averaging time measurements is discussed. The f-1-spectral density leads to results that depend on the length of time over which the measurements are made. An analysis of the effects of finite observation time is given. The characteristics of both passive and active atomic standards using a servo-controlled oscillator are discussed. The choice of servo time constant influences the frequency fluctuations observed as a function of averaging time and should be chosen for best performance with a given quartz oscillator and atomic reference. The conventional methods of handling random signals, i.e., variances, autocorrelation, and spectral densities, are applied to the special case of frequency and phase fluctuations in oscillators, in order to obtain meaningful criteria for specifying oscillator frequency stability. The interrelations between these specifications are developed in the course of the paper.},

    abstract         = {An important problem in econometrics and marketing is to infer the causal impact that a designed market intervention has exerted on an outcome metric over time. This paper proposes to infer causal impact on the basis of a diffusion-regression state-space model that predicts the counterfactual market response in a synthetic control that would have occurred had no intervention taken place. In contrast to classical difference-in-differences schemes, state-space models make it possible to (i) infer the temporal evolution of attributable impact, (ii) incorporate empirical priors on the parameters in a fully Bayesian treatment, and (iii) flexibly accommodate multiple sources of variation, including local trends, seasonality and the time-varying influence of contemporaneous covariates. Using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for posterior inference, we illustrate the statistical properties of our approach on simulated data. We then demonstrate its practical utility by estimating the causal effect of an online advertising campaign on search-related site visits. We discuss the strengths and limitations of state-space models in enabling causal attribution in those settings where a randomised experiment is unavailable. The CausalImpact R package provides an implementation of our approach.},

We propose a more general null hypothesis allowing for nonlinear rescalings of a Gaussian linear process. We show that such rescalings cannot be accounted for by a simple amplitude adjustment of the surrogates which leads to spurious detection of nonlinearity. An iterative algorithm is proposed to make appropriate surrogates which have the same autocorrelations as the data and the same probability distribution.},

The collective properties of this model produce a content-addressable memory which correctly yields an entire memory from any subpart of sufficient size. The algorithm for the time evolution of the state of the system is based on asynchronous parallel processing.

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

    abstract         = {A key challenge for neural modeling is to explain how a continuous stream of multimodal input from a rapidly changing environment can be processed by stereotypical recurrent circuits of integrate-and-fire neurons in real time. We propose a new computational model for real-time computing on time-varying input that provides an alternative to paradigms based on Turing machines or attractor neural networks. It does not require a task-dependent construction of neural circuits. Instead, it is based on principles of high-dimensional dynamical systems in combination with statistical learning theory and can be implemented on generic evolved or found recurrent circuitry. It is shown that the inherent transient dynamics of the high-dimensional dynamical system formed by a sufficiently large and heterogeneous neural circuit may serve as universal analog fading memory. Readout neurons can learn to extract in real time from the current state of such recurrent neural circuit information about current and past inputs that may be needed for diverse tasks. Stable internal states are not required for giving a stable output, since transient internal states can be transformed by readout neurons into stable target outputs due to the high dimensionality of the dynamical system. Our approach is based on a rigorous computational model, the liquid state machine, that, unlike Turing machines, does not require sequential transitions between well-defined discrete internal states. It is supported, as the Turing machine is, by rigorous mathematical results that predict universal computational power under idealized conditions, but for the biologically more realistic scenario of real-time processing of time-varying inputs. Our approach provides new perspectives for the interpretation of neural coding, the design of experiments and data analysis in neurophysiology, and the solution of problems in robotics and neurotechnology.},

    abstract         = {In this paper, an improved leaky integrator echo state network is proposed. The improved model, named double activation functions echo state network (DAF-ESN), introduces double activation functions to replace the original single activation function in the reservoir state update equation. For the purely input-driven applications, the model can flexibly modify the reservoir state according to different input signals. A sufficient condition for DAF-ESN is given to guarantee that DAF-ESN has the echo state property. Since double activation functions are represented as the weighted sum, two new parameters are introduced. The batch gradient descent method is utilized to optimize the parameters. Finally, the proposed method is applied to the time-series prediction. Simulation results show that the DAF-ESN model can greatly improve the accuracy of time-series prediction, while the operating time is not increased.},

    abstract         = {A neuronal population encodes information most efficiently when its stimulus responses are high-dimensional and uncorrelated, and most robustly when they are lower-dimensional and correlated. Here we analysed the dimensionality of the encoding of natural images by large populations of neurons in the visual cortex of awake mice. The evoked population activity was high-dimensional, and correlations obeyed an unexpected power law: the nth principal component variance scaled as 1/n. This scaling was not inherited from the power law spectrum of natural images, because it persisted after stimulus whitening. We proved mathematically that if the variance spectrum was to decay more slowly then the population code could not be smooth, allowing small changes in input to dominate population activity. The theory also predicts larger power-law exponents for lower-dimensional stimulus ensembles, which we validated experimentally. These results suggest that coding smoothness may represent a fundamental constraint that determines correlations in neural population codes.},

We simulate sets of time series using MAR models and investigate the diversity and coverage of the generated time series in a time series feature space. By tuning the parameters of the MAR models, GRATIS is also able to efficiently generate new time series with controllable features. In general, as a costless surrogate to the traditional data collection approach, GRATIS can be used as an evaluation tool for tasks such as time series forecasting and classification.

This view derives from what is known about primary visual cortex, where neural activity represents patterns of light. Yet it is unclear how well the analogy between motor and visual cortex holds. Single-neuron responses in motor cortex are complex, and there is marked disagreement regarding which movement parameters are represented. A better analogy might be with other motor systems, where a common principle is rhythmic neural activity. Here we find that motor cortex responses during reaching contain a brief but strong oscillatory component, something quite unexpected for a non-periodic behaviour. Oscillation amplitude and phase followed naturally from the preparatory state, suggesting a mechanistic role for preparatory neural activity. These results demonstrate an unexpected yet surprisingly simple structure in the population response. This underlying structure explains many of the confusing features of individual neural responses.},

In order to better understand the underlying circuitry, we performed retrograde injections of modified rabies virus in the visual cortex and pulvinar of the Long-Evans rat. We found a relatively small population of cells projecting to primary visual cortex (V1), compared to a much larger population projecting to higher visual cortex.

Using simultaneous recordings of visual-evoked activity in V1 and dLGN we demonstrate that thalamocortical communication involves synchronized local field potential oscillations in the high gamma range (50–90 Hz) which correspond uniquely to precise dLGN-V1 spike synchrony. These results provide evidence of a role for high gamma oscillations in mediating thalamocortical communication in the visual pathway of mice, analogous to beta oscillations in primates.},

A coherent framework describing pulvinar function remains elusive because of its anatomical complexity and involvement in diverse cognitive processes. We combined large-scale anatomical circuit mapping with high-density electrophysiological recordings to dissect a homolog of the pulvinar in mice, the lateral posterior thalamic nucleus (LP). We define three broad LP subregions based on correspondence between connectivity and functional properties. These subregions form corticothalamic loops biased toward ventral or dorsal stream cortical areas and contain separate representations of visual space. Silencing the visual cortex or superior colliculus revealed that they drive visual tuning properties in separate LP subregions. Thus, by specifying the driving input sources, functional properties, and downstream targets of LP circuits, our data provide a roadmap for understanding the mechanisms of higher-order thalamic function in vision.},

A central question in brain evolution is how cortical development affected the nature of cortical inputs to the hippocampus. To address this question, we compared cortico-hippocampal connectivity using intrinsic functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) in awake mice and humans. We found that fcMRI recapitulates anatomical connectivity, demonstrating sensory mapping within the mouse parahippocampal region. Moreover, we identified a similar topographical modality-specific organization along the longitudinal axis of the mouse hippocampus, indicating that sensory information arriving at the hippocampus is only partly integrated. Finally, comparing cortico-hippocampal connectivity across species, we discovered preferential hippocampal connectivity of sensory cortical networks in mice compared with preferential connectivity of association cortical networks in humans. Supporting this observation in humans but not in mice, sensory and association cortical networks are connected to spatially distinct subregions within the parahippocampal region. Collectively, these findings indicate that sensory cortical networks are coupled to the mouse but not the human hippocampal memory system, suggesting that the emergence of expanded and new association areas in humans resulted in the rerouting of cortical information flow and dissociation of primary sensory cortices from the hippocampus.},

    abstract         = {Causal reductionism is the widespread assumption that there is no room for additional causes once we have accounted for all elementary mechanisms within a system. Due to its intuitive appeal, causal reductionism is prevalent in neuroscience: once all neurons have been caused to fire or not to fire, it seems that causally there is nothing left to be accounted for. Here, we argue that these reductionist intuitions are based on an implicit, unexamined notion of causation that conflates causation with prediction. By means of a simple model organism, we demonstrate that causal reductionism cannot provide a complete and coherent account of ‘what caused what’. To that end, we outline an explicit, operational approach to analyzing causal structures.},

Here, we describe a diode-probe system that allows real-time and location-specific control of neuronal activity at multiple sites. Manipulation of neuronal activity in arbitrary spatiotemporal patterns is achieved by means of an optoelectronic array, manufactured by attaching multiple diode-fiber assemblies to high-density silicon probes or wire tetrodes and implanted into the brains of animals that are expressing light-responsive opsins. Each diode can be controlled separately, allowing localized light stimulation of neuronal activators and silencers in any temporal configuration and concurrent recording of the stimulated neurons. Because the only connections to the animals are via a highly flexible wire cable, unimpeded behavior is allowed for circuit monitoring and multisite perturbations in the intact brain. The capacity of the system to generate unique neural activity patterns facilitates multisite manipulation of neural circuits in a closed-loop manner and opens the door to addressing novel questions.},

    abstract         = {Despite the near universal assumption of individuality in biology, there is little agreement about what individuals are and few rigorous quantitative methods for their identification. Here, we propose that individuals are aggregates that preserve a measure of temporal integrity, i.e., “propagate” information from their past into their futures. We formalize this idea using information theory and graphical models. This mathematical formulation yields three principled and distinct forms of individuality—an organismal, a colonial, and a driven form—each of which varies in the degree of environmental dependence and inherited information. This approach can be thought of as a Gestalt approach to evolution where selection makes figure-ground (agent–environment) distinctions using suitable information-theoretic lenses. A benefit of the approach is that it expands the scope of allowable individuals to include adaptive aggregations in systems that are multi-scale, highly distributed, and do not necessarily have physical boundaries such as cell walls or clonal somatic tissue. Such individuals might be visible to selection but hard to detect by observers without suitable measurement principles. The information theory of individuality allows for the identification of individuals at all levels of organization from molecular to cultural and provides a basis for testing assumptions about the natural scales of a system and argues for the importance of uncertainty reduction through coarse-graining in adaptive systems.},

Triple and quadruple neuron recordings revealed that each synaptic connection established by neocortical pyramidal neurons is potentially unique. Specifically, synaptic connections onto the same morphological class differed in the numbers and dendritic locations of synaptic contacts, their absolute synaptic strengths, as well as their rates of synaptic depression and recovery from depression. The same axon of a pyramidal neuron innervating another pyramidal neuron and an interneuron mediated frequency-dependent depression and facilitation, respectively, during high frequency discharges of presynaptic action potentials, suggesting that the different natures of the target neurons underlie qualitative differences in synaptic properties. Facilitating-type synaptic connections established by three pyramidal neurons of the same class onto a single interneuron, were all qualitatively similar with a combination of facilitation and depression mechanisms. The time courses of facilitation and depression, however, differed for these convergent connections, suggesting that different pre-postsynaptic interactions underlie quantitative differences in synaptic properties. Mathematical analysis of the transfer functions of frequency-dependent synapses revealed supra-linear, linear, and sub-linear signaling regimes in which mixtures of presynaptic rates, integrals of rates, and derivatives of rates are transferred to targets depending on the precise values of the synaptic parameters and the history of presynaptic action potential activity. Heterogeneity of synaptic transfer functions therefore allows multiple synaptic representations of the same presynaptic action potential train and suggests that these synaptic representations are regulated in a complex manner. It is therefore proposed that differential signaling is a key mechanism in neocortical information processing, which can be regulated by selective synaptic modifications.},

Using a canonical feature-based representation, CompEngine places all time series in a common feature space, regardless of their origin, allowing users to upload their data and immediately explore diverse data with similar properties, and be alerted when similar data is uploaded in future. In contrast to conventional databases which are organized by assigned metadata, CompEngine incentivizes data sharing by automatically connecting experimental and theoretical scientists across disciplines based on the empirical structure of the data they measure. CompEngine’s growing library of interdisciplinary time-series data also enables the comprehensive characterization of time-series analysis algorithms across diverse types of empirical data.},

    abstract         = {Neural oscillations play critical roles in information processing, communication between brain areas, learning, and memory. We have recently discovered that familiar visual stimuli can robustly induce 5-Hz oscillations in the primary visual cortex (V1) of awake mice after the visual experience. To gain more mechanistic insight into this phenomenon, we used in vivo patch-clamp recordings to monitor the subthreshold activity of individual neurons during these oscillations. We analyzed the visual tuning properties of V1 neurons in naive and experienced mice to assess the effect of visual experience on the orientation and direction selectivity. Using optogenetic stimulation through the patch pipette in vivo, we measured the synaptic strength of specific intracortical and thalamocortical projections in vivo in the visual cortex before and after the visual experience. We found 5-Hz oscillations in membrane potential (Vm) and firing rates evoked in single neurons in response to the familiar stimulus, consistent with previous studies. Following the visual experience, the average firing rates of visual responses were reduced while the orientation and direction selectivities were increased. Light-evoked EPSCs were significantly increased for layer 5 (L5) projections to other layers of V1 after the visual experience, while the thalamocortical synaptic strength was decreased. In addition, we developed a computational model that could reproduce 5-Hz oscillations with enhanced neuronal selectivity following synaptic plasticity within the recurrent network and decreased feedforward input. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Neural oscillations at around 5 Hz are involved in visual working memory and temporal expectations in primary visual cortex (V1). However, how the oscillations modulate the visual response properties of neurons in V1 and their underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we show that these oscillations may alter the orientation and direction selectivity of the layer 2/3 (L2/3) neurons and correlate with the synaptic plasticity within V1. Our computational recurrent network model reproduces all these observations and provides a mechanistic framework for studying the role of 5-Hz oscillations in visual familiarity.},

These findings pinpoint the SST neurons in nRT as powerful modulators of the visual information encoding accuracy in V1 and represent a novel circuit through which the nRT can influence representation of visual information.},

We investigated the sources of the narrowband gamma oscillation, the factors modulating its strength, and its relationship to broadband gamma activity. Narrowband and broadband gamma power were uncorrelated. Increasing visual contrast had opposite effects on the two rhythms: it increased broadband activity, but suppressed the narrowband oscillation. The narrowband oscillation was strongest in layer 4 and was mediated primarily by excitatory currents entrained by the synchronous, rhythmic firing of neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). The power and peak frequency of the narrowband gamma oscillation increased with light intensity. Silencing the cortex optogenetically did not abolish the narrowband oscillation in either LGN firing or cortical excitatory currents, suggesting that this oscillation reflects unidirectional flow of signals from thalamus to cortex.},

Using a computer model we investigated whether top-down induced shifts in the relative alpha phase between two cortical areas could modulate cortical communication, quantified in terms of changes in gamma band coherence between them. The network model was comprised of two uni-directionally connected neuronal populations of spiking neurons, each representing a cortical area. We find that the phase difference of the alpha oscillations modulating the two neuronal populations strongly affected the interregional gamma-band neuronal coherence. We confirmed that a higher gamma band coherence also resulted in more efficient transmission of spiking information between cortical areas, thereby confirming the value of gamma coherence as a proxy for cortical information transmission. In a model where both neuronal populations were connected bi-directionally, the relative alpha phase determined the directionality of communication between the populations. Our results show the feasibility of a physiological realistic mechanism for routing information in the brain based on coupled oscillations. Our model results in a set of testable predictions regarding phase shifts in alpha oscillations under different task demands requiring experimental quantification of neuronal oscillations in different regions in e.g. attention paradigms.},

    abstract         = {The ventro-lateral pulvinar is reciprocally connected with the visual areas of the ventral stream that are important for object recognition. To understand the mechanisms of attentive stimulus processing in this pulvinar-cortex loop, we investigated the interactions between the pulvinar, area V4, and IT cortex in a spatial-attention task. Sensory processing and the influence of attention in the pulvinar appeared to reflect its cortical inputs. However, pulvinar deactivation led to a reduction of attentional effects on firing rates and gamma synchrony in V4, a reduction of sensory-evoked responses and overall gamma coherence within V4, and severe behavioral deficits in the affected portion of the visual field. Conversely, pulvinar deactivation caused an increase in low-frequency cortical oscillations, often associated with inattention or sleep. Thus, cortical interactions with the ventro-lateral pulvinar are necessary for normal attention and sensory processing and for maintaining the cortex in an active state.},

While gamma waves influence the feedforward processing, alpha oscillations travel in the feedback direction. Little is known how this oscillatory cortical communication depends on an alternative route that involves the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus. We investigated whether the oscillatory coupling between the primary visual cortex (area 17) and area 21a depends on the transthalamic pathway involving the pulvinar in cats. To that end, visual evoked responses were recorded in areas 17 and 21a before, during and after inactivation of the pulvinar. Local field potentials were analyzed with Wavelet and Granger causality tools to determine the oscillatory coupling between layers. The results indicate that cortical oscillatory activity was enhanced during pulvinar inactivation, in particular for area 21a. In area 17, alpha band responses were represented in layers II/III. In area 21a, gamma oscillations, except for layer I, were significantly increased, especially in layer IV. Granger causality showed that the pulvinar modulated the oscillatory information between areas 17 and 21a in gamma and alpha bands for the feedforward and feedback processing, respectively. Together, these findings indicate that the pulvinar is involved in the mechanisms underlying oscillatory communication along the visual cortex.},

In reflecting on this question, I come to the conclusion that perhaps the most important advance we have made is in gaining a deeper appreciation of the magnitude of the problem before us. While there has been steady progress in our understanding—and I will review some highlights here—we are still confronted with profound mysteries about how visual systems work. These are not just mysteries about biology, but also about the general principles that enable vision in any system whether it be biological or machine. I devote much of this chapter to examining these open questions, as they are crucial in guiding and motivating current efforts. Finally, I shall argue that the biggest mysteries are likely to be ones we are not currently aware of, and that bearing this in mind is important as it encourages a more exploratory, as opposed to strictly hypothesis-driven, approach.},

We rely on previously published works which provide a framework allowing us to take into account possible risk underestimations due to the non-optimality of the portfolio weights being used in order to distinguish such non-optimality effects from risk underestimations genuinely due to non-stationarities.

Decoupling among climate drivers complicates the assessment of ecological response to the changing climate as characteristics that could be once treated as a suite of conditions now need to be treated as potentially independent with possible synergistic effects. Ecologists commonly use ordination techniques (often principal component analysis; PCA) on large climate and environmental datasets to reduce a range of variables to a few axes that are uncorrelated with each other and often explain large proportion of the variation in the original data. However, non-stationarity, with correlations among variables changing over time, can affect this approach. Here, we use a 37-year climate dataset from the Niwot Ridge Long Term Ecological Research site (Colorado, USA) to present the use of both moving window principal component analysis and moving window correlation analysis to determine non-stationarity in climate data. Relationships among climate variables and between input variables and PCA axes changed over time; this obscured interpretation of relationships between PCA axes and an ecological response (plant biomass), suggesting that one-time PCA for environmental variables may lead to inappropriate inferences. Synthesis. Care must be taken in analysing climate–ecological relationships when predictor variables exhibit non-stationarity. We present a conceptual decision-making tree to help ecologists consider when to use PCA and extract axis scores or use alternative approaches for incorporating non-stationarity into subsequent analysis, including testing variables individually to aid in interpretation, break point analyses and averaging PC scores.},

Both spatial autocorrelation (the tendency for adjacent locations to be more similar than distant ones) and non-stationarity (the variation in modelled relationships over space) are likely to be common properties of ecological systems. This paper focuses on non-stationarity and uses two local techniques, geographically weighted regression (GWR) and varying coefficient modelling (VCM), to assess its impact on model predictions. We extend two published studies, one on the presence–absence of calandra larks in Spain and the other on bird species richness in Britain, to compare GWR and VCM with the more usual global generalized linear modelling (GLM) and generalized additive modelling (GAM). For the calandra lark data, GWR and VCM produced better-fitting models than GLM or GAM. VCM in particular gave significantly reduced spatial autocorrelation in the model residuals. GWR showed that individual predictors became stationary at different spatial scales, indicating that distributions are influenced by ecological processes operating over multiple scales. VCM was able to predict occurrence accurately on independent data from the same geographical area as the training data but not beyond, whereas the GAM produced good results on all areas. Individual predictions from the local methods often differed substantially from the global models. For the species richness data, VCM and GWR produced far better predictions than ordinary regression. Our analyses suggest that modellers interpolating data to produce maps for practical actions (e.g. conservation) should consider local methods, whereas they should not be used for extrapolation to new areas. We argue that local methods are complementary to global methods, revealing details of habitat associations and data properties which global methods average out and miss.},

    abstract         = {Resting-state functional connectivity is a powerful tool for studying human functional brain networks. Temporal fluctuations in functional connectivity, i.e., dynamic functional connectivity (dFC), are thought to reflect dynamic changes in brain organization and non-stationary switching of discrete brain states. However, recent studies have suggested that dFC might be attributed to sampling variability of static FC. Despite this controversy, a detailed exposition of stationarity and statistical testing of dFC is lacking in the literature. This article seeks an in-depth exploration of these statistical issues at a level appealing to both neuroscientists and statisticians. We first review the statistical notion of stationarity, emphasizing its reliance on ensemble statistics. In contrast, all FC measures depend on sample statistics. An important consequence is that the space of stationary signals is much broader than expected, e.g., encompassing hidden markov models (HMM) widely used to extract discrete brain states. In other words, stationarity does not imply the absence of brain states. We then expound the assumptions underlying the statistical testing of dFC. It turns out that the two popular frameworks - phase randomization (PR) and autoregressive randomization (ARR) - generate stationary, linear, Gaussian null data. Therefore, statistical rejection can be due to non-stationarity, nonlinearity and/or non-Gaussianity. For example, the null hypothesis can be rejected for the stationary HMM due to nonlinearity and non-Gaussianity. Finally, we show that a common form of ARR (bivariate ARR) is susceptible to false positives compared with PR and an adapted version of ARR (multivariate ARR). Application of PR and multivariate ARR to Human Connectome Project data suggests that the stationary, linear, Gaussian null hypothesis cannot be rejected for most participants. However, failure to reject the null hypothesis does not imply that static FC can fully explain dFC. We find that first order AR models explain temporal FC fluctuations significantly better than static FC models. Since first order AR models encode both static FC and one-lag FC, this suggests the presence of dynamical information beyond static FC. Furthermore, even in subjects where the null hypothesis was rejected, AR models explain temporal FC fluctuations significantly better than a popular HMM, suggesting the lack of discrete states (as measured by resting-state fMRI). Overall, our results suggest that AR models are not only useful as a means for generating null data, but may be a powerful tool for exploring the dynamical properties of resting-state fMRI. Finally, we discuss how apparent contradictions in the growing dFC literature might be reconciled.},

In most cases these technical fluctuations are responsible for spikes and their irregularity. The host nonlinearity of the laser rod is another poorly controllable factor. Dynamic instabilities and chaos are observed with confidence if all the random factors are excluded. This is permitted in solid-state ring lasers whose dynamics are governed by the interaction of frequency degenerate counterpropagating waves, which are the cavity modes. Thus the control parameters include the form of the atomic gain line, wave coupling coefficients and amplitude, and phase nonreciprocities of the laser cavity.},

It leads to transform the TFR to a local statistical features space from which we propose a method of segmentation. We illustrate our matter with first- and second-order statistics and identify the information they, respectively, provide. The segmentation is operated by a region growing algorithm, which does not require any prior knowledge on the nonstationary signal. The result is an automatic extraction of informative subsets from the TFR, which is relevant for the signal understanding. Examples are presented concerning synthetic and real signals.},

In this study, we have divided the EEG recordings during epileptic seizures into sequential stages using spectral and statistical analysis, and have as well reconstructed discrete-time models (maps) that reflect dynamical (deterministic) properties of the EEG voltage time series. Methods Intracranial human EEG recordings with epileptic seizures from three different subjects with medically intractable temporal lobe epilepsy were studied. The methods of statistical (power spectra, wavelet spectra, and one-dimensional probability distribution functions) and dynamical (comparison of dynamical models) nonstationarity analysis were applied. Results Dynamical nonstationarity analysis revealed more detailed inner structure within the seizures than the statistical analysis. Three or four stages with different dynamics are typically present within seizures. The difference between interictal activity and seizure events was also more evident through dynamical analysis. Conclusions Nonstationarity analysis can reveal temporal structure within an epileptic seizure, which could further understanding of how seizures evolve. The method could also be used for identification of seizure onset. Significance Our approach reveals new information about the temporal structure of seizures, which is inaccessible using conventional methods.},

    abstract         = {Spectral analysis based on neural field theory is used to analyze dynamic connectivity via methods based on the physical eigenmodes that are the building blocks of brain dynamics. These approaches integrate over space instead of averaging over time and thereby greatly reduce or remove the temporal averaging effects, windowing artifacts, and noise at fine spatial scales that have bedeviled the analysis of dynamical functional connectivity (FC). The dependences of FC on dynamics at various timescales, and on windowing, are clarified and the results are demonstrated on simple test cases, demonstrating how modes provide directly interpretable insights that can be related to brain structure and function. It is shown that FC is dynamic even when the brain structure and effective connectivity are fixed, and that the observed patterns of FC are dominated by relatively few eigenmodes. Common artifacts introduced by statistical analyses that do not incorporate the physical nature of the brain are discussed and it is shown that these are avoided by spectral analysis using eigenmodes. Unlike most published artificially discretized “resting state networks” and other statistically-derived patterns, eigenmodes overlap, with every mode extending across the whole brain and every region participating in every mode—just like the vibrations that give rise to notes of a musical instrument. Despite this, modes are independent and do not interact in the linear limit. It is argued that for many purposes the intrinsic limitations of covariance-based FC instead favor the alternative of tracking eigenmode coefficients vs. time, which provide a compact representation that is directly related to biophysical brain dynamics.},

Spectral analysis requires partitioning data into smaller epochs determined by the desired frequency resolution. The modified approach proposed here involves dividing the data within each epoch by the standard deviation of the data for that epoch. We applied this modified approach to cardiac beat-to-beat interval data recorded from a newborn infant undergoing hypothermia treatment for birth asphyxia. The critically ill infant had episodes of tachyarrhythmia, distributed sporadically throughout the study, which affected the stationarity of the heart rate. Over the period of continuous heart rate recording, the infant's clinical course deteriorated progressively culminating in death. Coinciding with this clinical deterioration, the heart rate signal showed striking changes in both low-frequency and high-frequency power indicating significant impairment of the autonomic nervous system. The standard spectral approach failed to capture these phenomena because of the non-stationarity of the signal. Conversely, the modified approach proposed here captured the deteriorating physiology of the infant clearly.},

    abstract         = {Neurons subject to a common nonstationary input may exhibit a correlated firing behavior. Correlations in the statistics of neural spike trains also arise as the effect of interaction between neurons. Here we show that these two situations can be distinguished with machine learning techniques, provided that the data are rich enough. In order to do this, we study the problem of inferring a kinetic Ising model, stationary or nonstationary, from the available data. We apply the inference procedure to two data sets: one from salamander retinal ganglion cells and the other from a realistic computational cortical network model. We show that many aspects of the concerted activity of the salamander retinal neurons can be traced simply to the external input. A model of non-interacting neurons subject to a nonstationary external field outperforms a model with stationary input with couplings between neurons, even accounting for the differences in the number of model parameters. When couplings are added to the nonstationary model, for the retinal data, little is gained: the inferred couplings are generally not significant. Likewise, the distribution of the sizes of sets of neurons that spike simultaneously and the frequency of spike patterns as a function of their rank (Zipf plots) are well explained by an independent-neuron model with time-dependent external input, and adding connections to such a model does not offer significant improvement. For the cortical model data, robust couplings, well correlated with the real connections, can be inferred using the nonstationary model. Adding connections to this model slightly improves the agreement with the data for the probability of synchronous spikes but hardly affects the Zipf plot.},

    abstract         = {Quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) are an important key to understand the dynamic behavior of astrophysical objects during transient events like gamma-ray bursts, solar flares, and magnetar flares. Searches for QPOs often use the periodogram of the time series and perform spectral density estimation using a Whittle likelihood function. However, the Whittle likelihood is only valid if the time series is stationary since the frequency bins are otherwise not statistically independent. We show that if time series are non-stationary, the significance of QPOs can be highly overestimated and estimates of the central frequencies and QPO widths can be overconstrained. The effect occurs if the QPO is only present for a fraction of the time series and the noise level is varying throughout the time series. This can occur for example if background noise from before or after the transient is included in the time series or if the low-frequency noise profile varies strongly over the time series. We confirm the presence of this bias in previously reported results from solar flare data and show that significance can be highly overstated. Finally, we provide some suggestions that help identify if an analysis is affected by this bias.},

    abstract         = {Most studies of turbulence in the solar wind invoke stationarity as a working hypothesis. Unfortunately, this concept is difficult to verify in practice. To investigate the validity of the weak stationarity assumption we consider magnetic field measurements made by the WIND satellite and study the properties of the autocorrelation function (ACF), which is a classical gauge for characteristic times or scales. We find that the ACF suffers from a high variance, which precludes the routine interpretation of correlation times and scales. In addition, the ACF fails to converge toward a constant function, even when considering the longest available intervals of either fast or slow solar wind. The reasons behind this lack of convergence are better understood by considering the power spectral density (PSD) of the magnetic field and analyzing synthetic data that exhibit the same PSD. Interestingly, we find evidence for an f−1 scaling at low frequencies in both fast and slow solar winds. These results, together with the theoretical properties of processes with f−γ scaling all point to the non-stationary behavior of the solar wind, in particular for scales that correspond to the inertial range. They also impose strong constraints on the applicability of ACF analysis as a tool for characterizing statistical properties of solar wind turbulence.},

The EEG wave pattern and frequency vary during five stages of sleep. These subtle variations in sleep EEG signals cannot be easily detected through visual inspection. \textbf{\textit{Summary:}} A range of time, frequency, time-frequency and nonlinear analysis methods can be applied to understand the complex physiological signals and their chaotic behavior. This paper presents a comprehensive comparative review and analysis of 29 nonlinear dynamics measures for EEG-based sleep stage detection. \textbf{\textit{Key Messages:}} The characteristic ranges of these features are reported for the five different sleep stages. All nonlinear measures produce clinically significant results, that is, they can discriminate the individual sleep stages. Feature ranking based on the statistical F-value, however, shows that the third order cumulant of higher order spectra yields the most discriminative result. The distinct value ranges for each sleep stage and the discriminative power of the features can be used for sleep disorder diagnosis, treatment monitoring, and drug efficacy assessment.},

By changing the four control parameters of pumping ratio, modulation frequency, modulation index, and modulator bias voltage, the laser dynamics can be modified all the way from period-1 to the chaotic regime. The presence of period-1, period-2, period-4, higher periods, and chaos confirm that the chaos is achieved through a period-doubling route. However, period-3 and period-6 are also obtained through other routes for certain parametric choices. The effect of the pumping ratio is also discussed. A higher value of pumping ratio requires a higher modulating signal amplitude to push the laser into the chaotic regime until the second laser threshold. Besides this, the chaotic regimes for the higher pumping ratio are wider in frequency and shifted toward higher frequencies. Calculations done with an established theoretical model provide a suitable handle on the parameters and help in emphasizing the control possible in this multiparameter dynamical system.},

    abstract         = {Background:
                        Snoring is a common symptom of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA) and has recently been considered for diagnosis of OSA.

                        Objectives:
                        The goal of the current study was to systematically determine the accuracy of acoustic analysis of snoring in the diagnosis of OSA using a meta-analysis.

                        Methods:
                        PubMed, Cochrane Library database, and EMBASE were searched up to July 15, 2014. A systematic review and meta-analysis of sensitivity, specificity, and other measures of accuracy of acoustic analysis of snoring in the diagnosis of OSA were conducted. The median of apneahypopnea index threshold was 10 events/h, range: 5–15 or 10–15 if aforementioned suggestion is adopted.

                        Results:
                        A total of seven studies with 273 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled estimates were as follows: sensitivity, 88\% (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 82–93\%); specificity, 81\% (95\% CI: 72–88\%); positive likelihood ratio (PLR), 4.44 (95\% CI: 2.39–8.27); negative likelihood ratio (NLR), 0.15 (95\% CI: 0.10–0.24); and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), 32.18 (95\% CI: 13.96–74.81). χ2 values of sensitivity, specificity, PLR, NLR, and DOR were 2.37, 10.39, 12.57, 3.79, and 6.91 respectively (All p {\textgreater} 0.05). The area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.93. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the pooled estimates were stable and reliable. The results of publication bias were not significant (p = 0.30).

                        Conclusions:
                        Acoustic analysis of snoring is a relatively accurate but not a strong method for diagnosing OSA. There is an urgent need for rigorous studies involving large samples and single snore event tests with an efficacy criterion that reflects the particular features of snoring acoustics for OSA diagnosis.

We investigate the behavior of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) component Bz, the Perreault-Akasofu coupling function and the AE, AL, AU, SYM-H, and ASY-H geomagnetic indices at different timescales by using the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method and the delayed mutual information (DMI). The EMD, indeed, allows to extract the intrinsic oscillations (modes) present into the different data sets, while the DMI, which provides a measure of the total amount of the linear and nonlinear shared information (correlation degree), allows to investigate the relevance of the different timescales in the solar wind-magnetosphere coupling. The results clearly indicate the existence of a relevant timescale separation in the solar wind-magnetosphere coupling. Indeed, while fluctuations at long timescales (t {\textgreater} 200 min) show a large degree of correlation between solar wind parameters and magnetospheric dynamics proxies, at short timescales (t {\textless} 200 min) this direct link is missing. This result suggests that fluctuations at timescales lower than 200 min, although triggered by changes of the interplanetary conditions, are mainly dominated by internal processes and are not directly driven by solar wind/IMF. Conversely, the magnetospheric dynamics in response to the solar wind/IMF driver at timescales longer than 200 min resembles the changes observed in the solar wind/IMF features. Finally, these results can be useful for Space Weather forecasting.},

In this article, we focus on electrical transmission networks and introduce a framework that takes into account both the event-based nature of cascades and the essentials of the network dynamics. We find that transients of the order of seconds in the flows of a power grid play a crucial role in the emergence of collective behaviors. We finally propose a forecasting method to identify critical lines and components in advance or during operation. Overall, our work highlights the relevance of dynamically induced failures on the synchronization dynamics of national power grids of different European countries and provides methods to predict and model cascading failures.},

We evaluate this hypothesis using data obtained from EHRs of 4486 post-cardiac surgical patients and a subset of 222 alerts generated from the data. We base the evaluation on the opinions of a panel of experts. The results of the study support our hypothesis that the outlier-based alerting can lead to promising true alert rates.

In this study, we evaluated 118 patients with Parkinson’s disease matched for age, sex and education with 35 healthy control subjects. Patients with Parkinson’s disease were classified with normal cognition (n = 52), mild cognitive impairment (n = 46), and dementia (n = 20) based on an extensive neuropsychological evaluation. Resting state functional MRI and a sliding-window approach were used to study the dynamic functional connectivity. Dynamic analysis suggested two distinct connectivity ‘States’ across the entire group: a more frequent, segregated brain state characterized by the predominance of within-network connections, State I, and a less frequent, integrated state with strongly connected functional internetwork components, State II. In Parkinson’s disease, State I occurred 13.89\% more often than in healthy control subjects, paralleled by a proportional reduction of State II. Parkinson’s disease subgroups analyses showed the segregated state occurred more frequently in Parkinson’s disease dementia than in mild cognitive impairment and normal cognition groups. Further, patients with Parkinson’s disease dementia dwelled significantly longer in the segregated State I, and showed a significant lower number of transitions to the strongly interconnected State II compared to the other subgroups. Our study indicates that dementia in Parkinson’s disease is characterized by altered temporal properties in dynamic connectivity. In addition, our results show that increased dwell time in the segregated state and reduced number of transitions between states are associated with presence of dementia in Parkinson’s disease. Further studies on dynamic functional connectivity changes could help to better understand the progressive dysfunction of networks between Parkinson’s disease cognitive states.},

Previous studies have demonstrated abnormalities in functional connectivity (FC) of AD under the assumption that FC is stationary during scanning. However, studies on the FC dynamics of AD, which may provide more insightful perspectives in understanding the neural mechanisms of AD, remain largely unknown. Methods Combining the sliding-window approach and the k-means algorithm, we identified three reoccurring dynamic FC states from resting-state fMRI data of 26 AD and 26 healthy controls. The between-group differences both in FC states and in regional temporal variability were calculated, followed by a correlation analysis of these differences with cognitive performances of AD patients. Results We identified three reoccurring FC states and found abnormal FC mainly in the frontal and temporal cortices. The temporal properties of FC states were changed in AD as characterized by decreased dwell time in State I and increased dwell time in State II. Besides, we found decreased regional temporal variability mainly in the somatomotor, temporal and parietal regions. Disrupted dynamic FC was significantly correlated with cognitive performances of AD patients. Conclusion Our findings suggest abnormal dynamic FC in AD patients, which provides novel insights for understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms of AD.},

A secondary purpose was to examine the effects of these biases on the generality and significance of findings in the most biased research areas. The Journal of Experimental Psychology and the Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology for recent years were examined. It was found that 73 percent of the articles in the J.A.S.P. and 85.7 percent of the articles in the J.E.P. used college students, chiefly male students enrolled in introductory psychology. Use of the general adult population or even samples representing particular sectors of that population is very rare in J.A.S.P., and not found at all in the J.E.P. It was pointed out that the college population differs markedly from the adult non-college population in many characteristics which are associated with psychological factors, e.g. age, social class, learning ability. It is concluded that the male college student has become the "white rat" of human experimentation and that a broadening of the bases for selecting subjects for experiments is in order.

    abstract         = {Within a population, individuals can often exhibit consistent differences in a range of behaviors across time and context (behavioral type) that are also correlated (behavioral syndrome). Recently, it has been suggested that an individual’s behavioral type can influence its probability of detection and capture during sampling. As a result, certain trapping methods may be inherently biased toward targeting a non-random sample of the population with wide ranging implications—from the way we conduct ecological research to the management and conservation of species. But is sampling bias always inevitable? Currently, studies have focused almost exclusively on the efficacy of passive trapping methods (e.g., baited traps) that rely on the arrival and inspection of animals, where bold, explorative individuals are typically oversampled. Whether more active search strategies result in similar bias remains unclear. In this study, we compared 3 different trapping methods (hand capture, pitfall trapping, and mealworm fishing) in their ability to capture a range of behavioral types within a population of the delicate skink ( Lampropholis delicata ). We also tested whether a behavioral syndrome was present. Although significant behavioral variation existed within the population, we found no difference between individuals caught in the 3 trapping methods among 5 behavioral traits. However, we did find the presence of a behavioral syndrome, where skinks that were consistently more active, explored an environment faster and were more likely to bask with other skinks. We suggest that trapping bias is not ubiquitous but instead might only be associated with passive trapping methods that involve the response of animals to novelty.},

The inflation of family variances and, thus, additive genetic variance and narrow sense individual heritabilities progressed exponentially with an increase in the nearest neighbor correlation (?) in the AR1 process. Significant differences in inflation rates persisted among various plot configurations. At ? = 0.2 the inflation of family variances reached 48–73\%. Inflation rates were independent of the level of heritability. Modified Papadakis nearest neighbor (NN) adjustment procedures were tested for their ability to remove the bias in family variances. A NN-adjustment based on Mead's coefficient of interplant interaction and one derived from Bartlett's simultaneous autoregressive scheme removed up to 97\% of the bias introduced by the phenotypic correlations. NN-adjusted estimates had slightly (5–8\%) higher relative errors than did unadjusted estimates.},

However in spatial applications, standard PCA is frequently applied without any adaptation that accounts for important spatial effects. Such a naive application can be problematic as such effects often provide a more complete understanding of a given process. In this respect, standard PCA can be (a) replaced with a geographically weighted PCA (GWPCA), when we want to account for a certain spatial heterogeneity; (b) adapted to account for spatial autocorrelation in the spatial process; or (c) adapted with a specification that represents a mixture of both (a) and (b). In this article, we focus on implementation issues concerning the calibration, testing, interpretation and visualisation of the location-specific principal components from GWPCA. Here we initially consider the basics of (global) principal components, then consider the development of a locally weighted PCA (for the exploration of local subsets in attribute-space) and finally GWPCA. As an illustration of the use of GWPCA (with respect to the implementation issues we investigate), we apply this technique to a study of social structure in Greater Dublin, Ireland.},

In this study, we introduced models combining probabilistic PCA and kriging models to infer population genetic structure from genetic data while correcting for effects generated by spatial autocorrelation. The corresponding algorithms are based on singular value decomposition and low rank approximation of the genotypic data. As their complexity is close to that of PCA, these algorithms scale with the dimensions of the data. To illustrate the utility of these new models, we simulated isolation-by-distance patterns and broad-scale geographic variation using spatial coalescent models. Our methods remove the horseshoe patterns usually observed in PC maps and simplify interpretations of spatial genetic variation. We demonstrate our approach by analyzing single nucleotide polymorphism data from the Human Genome Diversity Panel, and provide comparisons with other recently introduced methods.},

However, the different components need to be distinct from each other to be interpretable otherwise they only represent random directions. This is a fundamental assumption of PCA and, thus, needs to be tested every time. Sample correlation matrices will always result in a pattern of decreasing eigenvalues even if there is no structure. Tests are, therefore, needed to discern real patterns from illusionary ones. Furthermore, the loadings of the vectors need to be larger than expected by random data to be useful in the calculation of PC-scores. PC-scores calculated from nondistinct PC's have very large standard errors and cannot be used for biological interpretations. I give a number of examples to illustrate the potential problems with PCA. Robustness of the PC's increases with increasing sample size but not with the number of traits. I review a few simple test statistics appropriate for testing PC's and use a real-world example to illustrate how this can be done using randomization tests.

    abstract         = {With the development of high-throughput technologies, principal component analysis (PCA) in the high-dimensional regime is of great interest. Most of the existing theoretical and methodological results for high-dimensional PCA are based on the spiked population model in which all the population eigenvalues are equal except for a few large ones. Due to the presence of local correlation among features, however, this assumption may not be satisfied in many real-world datasets. To address this issue, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of PCA under the generalized spiked population model. Based on our theoretical results, we propose a series of methods for the consistent estimation of population eigenvalues, angles between the sample and population eigenvectors, correlation coefficients between the sample and population principal component (PC) scores, and the shrinkage bias adjustment for the predicted PC scores. Using numerical experiments and real data examples from the genetics literature, we show that our methods can greatly reduce bias and improve prediction accuracy.},

    abstract         = {Motivation: Classification and feature selection of genomics or transcriptomics data is often hampered by the large number of features as compared with the small number of samples available. Moreover, features represented by probes that either have similar molecular functions (gene expression analysis) or genomic locations (DNA copy number analysis) are highly correlated. Classical model selection methods such as penalized logistic regression or random forest become unstable in the presence of high feature correlations. Sophisticated penalties such as group Lasso or fused Lasso can force the models to assign similar weights to correlated features and thus improve model stability and interpretability. In this article, we show that the measures of feature relevance corresponding to the above-mentioned methods are biased such that the weights of the features belonging to groups of correlated features decrease as the sizes of the groups increase, which leads to incorrect model interpretation and misleading feature ranking.Results: With simulation experiments, we demonstrate that Lasso logistic regression, fused support vector machine, group Lasso and random forest models suffer from correlation bias. Using simulations, we show that two related methods for group selection based on feature clustering can be used for correcting the correlation bias. These techniques also improve the stability and the accuracy of the baseline models. We apply all methods investigated to a breast cancer and a bladder cancer arrayCGH dataset and in order to identify copy number aberrations predictive of tumor phenotype.Availability: R code can be found at: http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/{\textasciitilde}laura/Clustering.r.Contact:laura.tolosi@mpi-inf.mpg.deSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Besides basic research, it is clinically relevant for applications in Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, presurgical planning, epilepsy, and traumatic brain injury. Simulations of whole-brain mean-field computational models with realistic connectivity determined by tractography studies enable us to reproduce with accuracy aspects of average FC in the resting state. Most computational studies, however, did not address the prominent non-stationarity in resting state FC, which may result in large intra- and inter-subject variability and thus preclude an accurate individual predictability. Here we show that this non-stationarity reveals a rich structure, characterized by rapid transitions switching between a few discrete FC states. We also show that computational models optimized to fit time-averaged FC do not reproduce these spontaneous state transitions and, thus, are not qualitatively superior to simplified linear stochastic models, which account for the effects of structure alone. We then demonstrate that a slight enhancement of the non-linearity of the network nodes is sufficient to broaden the repertoire of possible network behaviors, leading to modes of fluctuations, reminiscent of some of the most frequently observed Resting State Networks. Because of the noise-driven exploration of this repertoire, the dynamics of FC qualitatively change now and display non-stationary switching similar to empirical resting state recordings (Functional Connectivity Dynamics (FCD)). Thus FCD bear promise to serve as a better biomarker of resting state neural activity and of its pathologic alterations.},

    abstract         = {The brain is exceptional at responding to changes in its environment: a fast-moving object, a new sound, or a demanding task. Investigating how environmental parameters translate to complex, high-dimensional neuronal activity requires powerful techniques that can uncover patterns buried in large spatio-temporal datasets. Standard methods of dimensionality reduction excel at finding global low-dimensional structure in multivariate datasets, but do not provide fine-grained information about how the dynamics of individual neural elements change over time. Such local dynamics can be crucial for understanding the function and organization of heterogeneous structures in the brain. In this talk, I will present a new method for producing compact and interpretable summaries of non-stationary time series. By representing time series as trajectories in a low-dimensional feature space, where each dimension quantifies an informative dynamical property, we can directly observe non-stationary variation in neural activity. Using this method, we are able to reduce the dimensionality of spatio-temporal data without losing a local perspective on dynamics. I will demonstrate our novel approach using the Allen Neuropixels Visual Coding dataset, a highly spatio-temporal set of electrophysiological recordings from the mouse brain aimed at investigating neural responses to visual stimuli. Our method can discriminate components of the visual hierarchy based on their unique dynamics during various stimuli, providing an understanding of the local characteristics of neural activity directly from data, without supervision or modelling. Our approach opens new avenues to investigating non-stationary neural data and better understanding how components of the brain change in response to its environment.},

Using voltage-sensitive dye imaging, we found that spiral waves occur frequently in the neocortex in vivo, both during pharmacologically induced oscillations and during sleep-like states. While their lifespan is limited, spiral waves can modify ongoing cortical activity by influencing oscillation frequencies and spatial coherence, and by reducing amplitude in the area surrounding the spiral phase singularity. During sleep-like states, the rate of occurrence of spiral waves varies greatly depending on brain states. These results support the hypothesis that spiral waves, as an emergent activity pattern, can organize and modulate cortical population activity on the mesoscopic scale and may contribute to both normal cortical processing and to pathological patterns of activity such as those found in epilepsy.},

Such spatiotemporal patterns have been linked to brain function and observed across multiple recording methodologies and scales. The ability to detect and analyze these patterns is thus essential for understanding the working mechanisms of neural circuits. Here we present a mathematical and computational framework for the identification and analysis of multiple classes of wave patterns in neural population-level recordings. By drawing a conceptual link between spatiotemporal patterns found in the brain and coherent structures such as vortices found in turbulent flows, we introduce velocity vector fields to characterize neural population activity. These vector fields are calculated for both phase and amplitude of oscillatory neural signals by adapting optical flow estimation methods from the field of computer vision. Based on these velocity vector fields, we then introduce order parameters and critical point analysis to detect and characterize a diverse range of propagating wave patterns, including planar waves, sources, sinks, spiral waves, and saddle patterns. We also introduce a novel vector field decomposition method that extracts the dominant spatiotemporal structures in a recording. This enables neural data to be represented by the activity of a small number of independent spatiotemporal modes, providing an alternative to existing dimensionality reduction techniques which separate space and time components. We demonstrate the capabilities of the framework and toolbox with simulated data, local field potentials from marmoset visual cortex and optical voltage recordings from whole mouse cortex, and we show that pattern dynamics are non-random and are modulated by the presence of visual stimuli. These methods are implemented in a MATLAB toolbox, which is freely available under an open-source licensing agreement.},

In particular, the strength of phase-amplitude CFC differs across brain areas in a task-relevant manner, changes quickly in response to sensory, motor, and cognitive events, and correlates with performance in learning tasks. Importantly, while high-frequency brain activity reflects local domains of cortical processing, low-frequency brain rhythms are dynamically entrained across distributed brain regions by both external sensory input and internal cognitive events. CFC may thus serve as a mechanism to transfer information from large-scale brain networks operating at behavioral timescales to the fast, local cortical processing required for effective computation and synaptic modification, thus integrating functional systems across multiple spatiotemporal scales.},

    abstract         = {Oscillatory activity in the brain has been associated with a wide variety of cognitive processes including decision making, feedback processing, and working memory. The high temporal resolution provided by electroencephalography (EEG) enables the study of variation of oscillatory power and coupling across time. Various forms of neural synchrony across frequency bands have been suggested as the mechanism underlying neural binding. Recently, a considerable amount of work has focused on phase-amplitude coupling (PAC)– a form of cross-frequency coupling where the amplitude of a high frequency signal is modulated by the phase of low frequency oscillations. The existing methods for assessing PAC have some limitations including limited frequency resolution and sensitivity to noise, data length and sampling rate due to the inherent dependence on bandpass filtering. In this paper, we propose a new time-frequency based PAC (t-f PAC) measure that can address these issues. The proposed method relies on a complex time-frequency distribution, known as the Reduced Interference Distribution (RID)-Rihaczek distribution, to estimate both the phase and the envelope of low and high frequency oscillations, respectively. As such, it does not rely on bandpass filtering and possesses some of the desirable properties of time-frequency distributions such as high frequency resolution. The proposed technique is first evaluated for simulated data and then applied to an EEG speeded reaction task dataset. The results illustrate that the proposed time-frequency based PAC is more robust to varying signal parameters and provides a more accurate measure of coupling strength.},

It has been widely observed in the brain and linked to various brain functions. In this paper, we show that Stuart-Landau oscillators coupled in a nonlinear fashion can give rise to PAC in two commonly accepted architectures, namely, (1) a high-frequency neural oscillation driven by an external low-frequency input and (2) two interacting local oscillations with distinct, locally generated frequencies. We characterize the parameters that affect PAC behavior, thus providing insight on this phenomenon observed in neuronal networks. Inspired by some empirical studies, we further present an interconnection structure for brain regions wherein cross-region interactions are established only by low-frequency oscillations. We then demonstrate that low-frequency phase synchrony can integrate high-frequency activities regulated by local PAC and control the direction of information flow between distant regions.},

    abstract         = {Aggregate signals in cortex are known to be spatiotemporally organized as propagating waves across the cortical surface, but it remains unclear whether the same is true for spiking activity in individual neurons. Furthermore, the functional interactions between cortical neurons are well documented but their spatial arrangement on the cortical surface has been largely ignored. Here we use a functional network analysis to demonstrate that a subset of motor cortical neurons in non-human primates spatially coordinate their spiking activity in a manner that closely matches wave propagation measured in the beta oscillatory band of the local field potential. We also demonstrate that sequential spiking of pairs of neuron contains task-relevant information that peaks when the neurons are spatially oriented along the wave axis. We hypothesize that the spatial anisotropy of spike patterning may reflect the underlying organization of motor cortex and may be a general property shared by other cortical areas.},

    abstract         = {Neocortical “theta” oscillation (5–12 Hz) has been observed in animals and human subjects but little is known about how the oscillation is organized in the cortical intrinsic networks. Here we use voltage-sensitive dye and optical imaging to study a carbachol/bicuculline induced theta (∼8 Hz) oscillation in rat neocortical slices. The imaging has large signal-to-noise ratio, allowing us to map the phase distribution over the neocortical tissue during the oscillation. The oscillation was organized as spontaneous epochs and each epoch was composed of a “first spike,” a “regular” period (with relatively stable frequency and amplitude), and an “irregular” period (with variable frequency and amplitude) of oscillations. During each cycle of the regular oscillation, one wave of activation propagated horizontally (parallel to the cortical lamina) across the cortical section at a velocity of ∼50 mm/s. Vertically the activity was synchronized through all cortical layers. This pattern of one propagating wave associated with one oscillation cycle was seen during all the regular cycles. The oscillation frequency varied noticeably at two neighboring horizontal locations (330 μm apart), suggesting that the oscillation is locally organized and each local oscillator is about ≤300 μm wide horizontally. During irregular oscillations, the spatiotemporal patterns were complex and sometimes the vertical synchronization decomposed, suggesting a de-coupling among local oscillators. Our data suggested that neocortical theta oscillation is sustained by multiple local oscillators. The coupling regime among the oscillators may determine the spatiotemporal pattern and switching between propagating waves and irregular patterns.},

    abstract         = {Brain activity can follow the rhythms of dynamic sensory stimuli, such as speech and music, a phenomenon called neural entrainment. It has been hypothesized that low-frequency neural entrainment in the neural delta and theta bands provides a potential mechanism to represent and integrate temporal information. Low-frequency neural entrainment is often studied using periodically changing stimuli and is analyzed in the frequency domain using the Fourier analysis. The Fourier analysis decomposes a periodic signal into harmonically related sinusoids. However, it is not intuitive how these harmonically related components are related to the response waveform. Here, we explain the interpretation of response harmonics, with a special focus on very low-frequency neural entrainment near 1 Hz. It is illustrated why neural responses repeating at f Hz do not necessarily generate any neural response at f Hz in the Fourier spectrum. A strong neural response at f Hz indicates that the time scales of the neural response waveform within each cycle match the time scales of the stimulus rhythm. Therefore, neural entrainment at very low frequency implies not only that the neural response repeats at f Hz but also that each period of the neural response is a slow wave matching the time scale of a f Hz sinusoid.},

The method can be used to efficiently derive the continuous-wave response of numerous nonlinear microwave components including amplifiers, mixers, and oscillators. Its efficiency derives from imposing a predetermined steady-state form for the circuit response onto the nonlinear equations representing the network, and solving for the set of unknown coefficients in the response equation. Its attractiveness for nonlinear microwave applications results from its speed and ability to simply represent the dispersive, distributed elements that are common at high frequencies. The last decade has seen the development and application of harmonic balance techniques to model analog circuits, particularly microwave circuits. The first part of this paper reviews the fundamental achievements made during this time. The second part covers the extension of the method to quasi-periodic regimes, optimization analysis, and practical application. A critical assessment of the various types of harmonic balance techniques is given. The different sampling and Fourier transform methods are compared, and numerical speed and precision results are given enabling a quantitative analysis of the merits of the major variants of the harmonic balance technique. Examples of designs which have been modeled using the harmonic balance technique and built both in hybrid and MMIC form are presented.},

We found a ≈4-Hz theta rhythm within both the V1–V2 and the V4–TEO region, and theta synchronization between them, with a predominantly feedforward directed influence. ECoG coverage of large parts of these regions revealed a surprising spatial correspondence between theta and visually induced gamma. Furthermore, gamma power was modulated with theta phase. Selective attention to the respective visual stimulus strongly reduced these theta-rhythmic processes, leading to an unusually strong attention effect for V1. Microsaccades (MSs) were partly locked to theta. However, neuronal theta rhythms tended to be even more pronounced for epochs devoid of MSs. Thus, we find an MS-independent theta rhythm specific to visually driven parts of V1–V2, which rhythmically modulates local gamma and entrains V4–TEO, and which is strongly reduced by attention. We propose that the less theta-rhythmic and thereby more continuous processing of the attended stimulus serves the exploitation of this behaviorally most relevant information. The theta-rhythmic and thereby intermittent processing of the unattended stimulus likely reflects the ecologically important exploration of less relevant sources of information.},

This cross-frequency coupling has been linked to working memory and spatial memory consolidation; however, its spatial and temporal dynamics remains unclear. Here, we first investigate the dynamics of theta–gamma interactions using multiple frequency and temporal scales in simultaneous recordings from hippocampal CA3, CA1, subiculum, and parietal cortex in freely moving mice. We found that theta phase dynamically modulates distinct gamma bands during REM sleep. Interestingly, we further show that theta–gamma coupling switches between recorded brain structures during REM sleep and progressively increases over a single REM sleep episode. Finally, we show that optogenetic silencing of septohippocampal GABAergic projections significantly impedes both theta–gamma coupling and theta phase coherence. Collectively, our study shows that phase-space (i.e. cross-frequency coupling) coding of information during REM sleep is orchestrated across time and space consistent with region-specific processing of information during REM sleep including learning and memory.}},

These involve correlation of oscillatory properties with memory states, correlation with memory performance, and effects of disrupting oscillations on memory.

Hippocampal theta waves were asymmetric, and estimation of the spatial position of the animal was improved by identifying the waveform-based phase of spiking, compared to traditional methods used for phase estimation. Using the waveform-based theta phase, three distinct gamma bands were identified: slow gamma(S) (gamma(S); 30-50 Hz), midfrequency gamma(M) (gamma(M); 50-90 Hz), and fast gamma(F) (gamma(F); 90-150 Hz or epsilon band). The amplitude of each sub-band was modulated by the theta phase. In addition, we found reliable phase-phase coupling between theta and both gamma(S) and gamma(M) but not gamma(F) oscillators.

    abstract         = {Many complex spike cells in the hippocampus of the freely moving rat have as their primary correlate the animal's location in an environment (place cells). In contrast, the hippocampal electroer cephalograph theta pattern of rhythmical waves (7–12 Hz) is better correlated with a class of movements that change the rat's location in an environment. During movement through the place field, the complex spike cells often fire in a bursting pattern with an interburst frequency in the same range as the concurrent electroencephalograph theta. The present study examined the phase of the theta wave at which the place cells fired. It was found that firing consistently began at a particular phase as the rat entered the field but then shifted in a systematic way during traversal of the field, moving progressively forward on each theta cycle. This precession of the phase ranged from 100° to 355° in different cells. The effect appeared to be due to the fact that individual cells had a higher interburst rate than the theta frequency. The phase was highly correlated with spatial location and less well correlated with temporal aspects of behavior, such as the time after place field entry. These results have implications for several aspects of hippocampal function. First, by using the phase relationship as well as the firing rate, place cells can improve the accuracy of place coding. Second, the characteristics of the phase shift constrain the models that define the construction of place fields. Third, the results restrict the temporal and spatial circumstances under which synapses in the hippocampus could be modified.},

    abstract         = {{Activity in the mammalian thalamocortical system is often accompanied by a synchronous discharge of cortical and thalamic neurons. Although many functions have been attributed to such synchronous firing, it is not known whether or how synchrony of firing per se affects thalamocortical operations. Direct experimental tests of the consequences of neuronal synchronization in vivo are hard to carry out, whereas theoretical studies based on single-neuron models cannot reveal the effects of synchrony at the system level. To overcome these limitations, we have used a perturbational approach to test the causal efficacy of synchrony per se in large-scale simulations of the thalamocortical system. The test consists of selectively disrupting firing synchrony by 'jittering' the timing of action potentials in the simulations and determining whether firing rates are modified by this perturbation. The simulations are based in detail on the known anatomy and physiology of the thalamocortical-visual system of the cat, and have been shown in a companion paper to produce episodes of fast synchronous activity at multiple levels. By carrying out the perturbation analysis, we established that neurons can have long membrane time constants (8-16 ms) and balanced synaptic activations, and yet function collectively in such a way that synchrony within a time window of 4 ms significantly affects the rates and selectivity of the responses to visual stimuli. The simulations also revealed a complex interplay, at the network level, between synchrony of firing and rate of firing. The dynamic consequences of firing synchrony were most evident when spike jittering was applied to specific polysynaptic loops involving corticocortical and corticothalamic connections. These results support the view that firing synchrony within thalamocortical and corticocortical loops plays a causal role in the cooperative and competitive neural interactions that produce pattern-selective responses in the cortex.}},

Numerically, its synapses dominate the inputs to relay cells and to the gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA)ergic cells of the reticular nucleus (RTN). The capacity of relay neurons to operate in different voltage-dependent functional modes determines that the inputs from the cortex have the capacity directly to excite the relay cells, or indirectly to inhibit them via the RTN, serving to synchronize high- or low-frequency oscillatory activity respectively in the thalamocorticothalamic network. Differences in the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) subunit composition of receptors at synapses formed by branches of the same corticothalamic axon in the RTN and dorsal thalamus are an important element in the capacity of the cortex to synchronize low-frequency oscillations in the network. Interactions of focused corticothalamic axons arising from layer VI cortical cells and diffuse corticothalamic axons arising from layer V cortical cells, with the specifically projecting core relay cells and diffusely projecting matrix cells of the dorsal thalamus, form a substrate for synchronization of widespread populations of cortical and thalamic cells during high-frequency oscillations that underlie discrete conscious events.},

We show that the neural field model exhibits a rich repertoire of dynamical activity states when the relevant strength of excitation and inhibition is increased, ranging from localized rotating and traveling waves to global waves. Particularly, near the transition between stable states of rotating and traveling waves, the model exhibits a bistable state; that is, both the rotating and the traveling waves can exist, and the inclusion of noise can induce spontaneous transitions between them. Furthermore, we demonstrate that when there are multiple propagating waves, they exhibit rich collective propagation dynamics with variable propagating speeds and trajectories. We use techniques from time series analysis such detrended fluctuation analysis to characterize the effect of the strength of excitation and inhibition on these collective dynamics, which range from purely random motion to motion with long-range spatiotemporal correlations.

    abstract         = {Synchronous, rhythmic changes in the membrane polarization of neurons form oscillations in local field potentials. It is hypothesized that high-frequency brain oscillations reflect local cortical information processing, and low-frequency brain oscillations project information flow across larger cortical networks. This provides complex forms of information transmission due to interactions between oscillations at different frequency bands, which can be rendered with cross-frequency coupling (CFC) metrics. Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) is one of the most common representations of the CFC. PAC reflects the coupling of the phase of oscillations in a specific frequency band to the amplitude of oscillations in another frequency band. In a normal brain, PAC accompanies multi-item working memory in the hippocampus, and changes in PAC have been associated with diseases such as schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), Alzheimer disease (AD), epilepsy, and Parkinson’s disease (PD). The purpose of this article is to explore CFC across the central nervous system and demonstrate its correlation to neurological disorders. Results from previously published studies are reviewed to explore the significant role of CFC in large neuronal network communication and its abnormal behavior in neurological disease. Specifically, the association of effective treatment in PD such as dopaminergic medication and deep brain stimulation with PAC changes is described. Lastly, CFC analysis of the electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals recorded from the motor cortex of a Parkinson’s disease patient and the parahippocampal gyrus of an epilepsy patient are demonstrated. This information taken together illuminates possible roles of CFC in the nervous system and its potential as a therapeutic target in disease states. This will require new neural interface technologies such as phase-dependent stimulation triggered by PAC changes, for the accurate recording, monitoring, and modulation of the CFC signal.},

    abstract         = {The integrate-and-fire neuron model is one of the most widely used models for analyzing the behavior of neural systems. It describes the membrane potential of a neuron in terms of the synaptic inputs and the injected current that it receives. An action potential (spike) is generated when the membrane potential reaches a threshold, but the actual changes associated with the membrane voltage and conductances driving the action potential do not form part of the model. The synaptic inputs to the neuron are considered to be stochastic and are described as a temporally homogeneous Poisson process. Methods and results for both current synapses and conductance synapses are examined in the diffusion approximation, where the individual contributions to the postsynaptic potential are small. The focus of this review is upon the mathematical techniques that give the time distribution of output spikes, namely stochastic differential equations and the Fokker–Planck equation. The integrate-and-fire neuron model has become established as a canonical model for the description of spiking neurons because it is capable of being analyzed mathematically while at the same time being sufficiently complex to capture many of the essential features of neural processing. A number of variations of the model are discussed, together with the relationship with the Hodgkin–Huxley neuron model and the comparison with electrophysiological data. A brief overview is given of two issues in neural information processing that the integrate-and-fire neuron model has contributed to – the irregular nature of spiking in cortical neurons and neural gain modulation.},

    abstract         = {Visual stimuli can evoke waves of neural activity that propagate across the surface of visual cortical areas. The relevance of these waves for visual processing is unknown. Here, we measured the phase and amplitude of local field potentials (LFPs) in electrode array recordings from the motion-processing medial temporal (MT) area of anesthetized male marmosets. Animals viewed grating or dot-field stimuli drifting in different directions. We found that, on individual trials, the direction of LFP wave propagation is sensitive to the direction of stimulus motion. Propagating LFP patterns are also detectable in trial-averaged activity, but the trial-averaged patterns exhibit different dynamics and behaviors from those in single trials and are similar across motion directions. We show that this difference arises because stimulus-sensitive propagating patterns are present in the phase of single-trial oscillations, whereas the trial-averaged signal is dominated by additive amplitude effects. Our results demonstrate that propagating LFP patterns can represent sensory inputs at timescales relevant to visually guided behaviors and raise the possibility that propagating activity patterns serve neural information processing in area MT and other cortical areas.
                        SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Propagating wave patterns are widely observed in the cortex, but their functional relevance remains unknown. We show here that visual stimuli generate propagating wave patterns in local field potentials (LFPs) in a movement-sensitive area of the primate cortex and that the propagation direction of these patterns is sensitive to stimulus motion direction. We also show that averaging LFP signals across multiple stimulus presentations (trial averaging) yields propagating patterns that capture different dynamic properties of the LFP response and show negligible direction sensitivity. Our results demonstrate that sensory stimuli can modulate propagating wave patterns reliably in the cortex. The relevant dynamics are normally masked by trial averaging, which is a conventional step in LFP signal processing.},

    abstract         = {Lévy walks describe patterns of intermittent motion with variable step sizes. In complex biological systems, Lévy walks (non-Brownian, superdiffusive random walks) are associated with behaviors such as search patterns of animals foraging for food. Here we show that Lévy walks also describe patterns of oscillatory activity in primate cerebral cortex. We used a combination of empirical observation and modeling to investigate high-frequency (gamma band) local field potential activity in visual motion-processing cortical area MT of marmoset monkeys. We found that gamma activity is organized as localized burst patterns that propagate across the cortical surface with Lévy walk dynamics. Lévy walks are fundamentally different from either global synchronization, or regular propagating waves, because they include large steps that enable activity patterns to move rapidly over cortical modules. The presence of Lévy walk dynamics therefore represents a previously undiscovered mode of brain activity, and implies a novel way for the cortex to compute. We apply a biophysically realistic circuit model to explain that the Lévy walk dynamics arise from critical-state transitions between asynchronous and localized propagating wave states, and that these dynamics yield optimal spatial sampling of the cortical sheet. We hypothesise that Lévy walk dynamics could help the cortex to efficiently process variable inputs, and to find links in patterns of activity among sparsely spiking populations of neurons.},

    abstract         = {Epilepsy is characterized by paradoxical patterns of neural activity. They may cause different types of electroencephalogram (EEG), which dynamically change in shape and frequency content during the temporal evolution of seizure. It is generally assumed that these epileptic patterns may originate in a network of strongly interconnected neurons, when excitation dominates over inhibition. The aim of this work is to use a neural network composed of 50×50 integrate-and-fire neurons to analyse which parameter alterations, at the level of synapse topology, may induce network instability and epileptic-like discharges, and to study the corresponding spatio-temporal characteristics of electrical activity in the network. We assume that a small group of central neurons is stimulated by a depolarizing current (epileptic focus) and that neurons are connected via a Mexican-hat topology of synapses. A signal representative of cortical EEG (ECoG) is simulated by summing the membrane potential changes of all neurons. A sensitivity analysis on the parameters describing the synapse topology shows that an increase in the strength and in spatial extension of excitatory vs. inhibitory synapses may cause the occurrence of travelling waves, which propagate along the network. These propagating waves may cause EEG patterns with different shape and frequency, depending on the particular parameter set used during the simulations. The resulting model EEG signals include irregular rhythms with large amplitude and a wide frequency content, low-amplitude high-frequency rapid discharges, isolated or repeated bursts, and low-frequency quasi-sinusoidal patterns. A slow progressive temporal variation in a single parameter may cause the transition from one pattern to another, thus generating a highly non-stationary signal which resembles that observed during ECoG measurements. These results may help to elucidate the mechanisms at the basis of some epileptic discharges, and to relate rapid changes in EEG patterns with the underlying alterations at the network level.},

    abstract         = {Spiral waves in the neocortex may provide a spatial framework to organize cortical oscillations, thus help signal communication. However, noise influences spiral wave. Many previous theoretical studies about noise mainly focus on unbounded Gaussian noise, which contradicts that a real physical quantity is always bounded. Furthermore, non-Gaussian noise is also important for dynamical behaviors of excitable media. Nevertheless, there are no results concerning the effect of bounded noise on spiral wave till now. Based on Hodgkin-Huxley neuron model subjected to bounded noise with the form of Asin[ωt + σW(t)], the influences of bounded noise on the formation and instability of spiral wave in a two-dimensional (2D) square lattice of neurons are investigated in detail by separately adjusting the intensity σ, amplitude A, and frequency f of bounded noise. It is found that the increased intensity σ can facilitate the formation of spiral wave while the increased amplitude A tends to destroy spiral wave. Furthermore, frequency of bounded noise has the effect of facilitation or inhibition on pattern synchronization. Interestingly, for the appropriate intensity, amplitude and frequency can separately induce resonance-like phenomenon.},

    abstract         = {Traveling patterns of neuronal activity—brain waves—have been observed across a breadth of neuronal recordings, states of awareness, and species, but their emergence in the human brain lacks a firm understanding. Here we analyze the complex nonlinear dynamics that emerge from modeling large-scale spontaneous neural activity on a whole-brain network derived from human tractography. We find a rich array of three-dimensional wave patterns, including traveling waves, spiral waves, sources, and sinks. These patterns are metastable, such that multiple spatiotemporal wave patterns are visited in sequence. Transitions between states correspond to reconfigurations of underlying phase flows, characterized by nonlinear instabilities. These metastable dynamics accord with empirical data from multiple imaging modalities, including electrical waves in cortical tissue, sequential spatiotemporal patterns in resting-state MEG data, and large-scale waves in human electrocorticography. By moving the study of functional networks from a spatially static to an inherently dynamic (wave-like) frame, our work unifies apparently diverse phenomena across functional neuroimaging modalities and makes specific predictions for further experimentation.},

Spindles have been increasingly demonstrated to be critical for sleep-dependent consolidation of memory, but the specific neural mechanism for this process remains unclear. We show here that cortical spindles are spatiotemporally organized into circular wave-like patterns, organizing neuronal activity over tens of milliseconds, within the timescale for storing memories in large-scale networks across the cortex via spike-time dependent plasticity. These circular patterns repeat over hours of sleep with millisecond temporal precision, allowing reinforcement of the activity patterns through hundreds of reverberations. These results provide a novel mechanistic account for how global sleep oscillations and synaptic plasticity could strengthen networks distributed across the cortex to store coherent and integrated memories.},

To predict the future phase of cortical activity at localized ECoG and MEG recording sites, we exploit its predominant, large-scale, spatiotemporal dynamics. The dynamics are extracted from the brain signal through Fourier analysis and principal components analysis (PCA) only, and cast in a data model that predicts future signal at each site and frequency of interest. The dominant eigenvectors of the PCA that map the large-scale patterns of past cortical phase to future ones take the form of smoothly propagating waves over the entire measurement array. In ECoG data from 3 subjects and MEG data from 20 subjects collected during a self-initiated motor task, mean phase prediction errors were as low as 0.5 radians at local sites, surpassing state-of-the-art methods of within-time-series or event-related models. Prediction accuracy was highest in delta to beta bands, depending on the subject, was more accurate during episodes of high global power, but was not strongly dependent on the time-course of the task. Prediction results did not require past data from the to-be-predicted site. Rather, best accuracy depended on the availability in the model of long wavelength information. The utility of large-scale, low spatial frequency traveling waves in predicting future phase activity at local sites allows estimation of the error introduced by failing to account for irreducible trajectories in the activity dynamics.},

Neural fields consisting of single layer are first treated, and it is proved that there are five types of pattern dynamics. The type of the dynamics of a field depends not only on the mutual connections within the field but on the level of homogeneous stimulus given to the field. An example of the dynamics is as follows: A fixed size of localized excitation, once evoked by stimulation, can be retained in the field persistently even after the stimulation vanishes. It moves until it finds the position of the maximum of the input stimulus. Fields consisting of an excitatory and an inhibitory layer are next analyzed. In addition to stationary localized excitation, fields have such pattern dynamics as production of oscillatory waves, travelling waves, active and dual active transients, etc.},

This mode of computation explains how one scheme of neuroarchitecture can be used for very different sensory modalities and seemingly different computations. The oscillations and anatomy of the mammalian olfactory systems have a simple interpretation in terms of this representation, and relate to processing in the auditory system. Single-electrode recording would not detect such neural computing. Recognition 'units' in this style respond more like radial basis function units than elementary sigmoid units.},

To verify whether the determinant is nozero for a class of matrix, a numerical range test is proposed. Several robust control techniques in particular linear matrix inequalities are used to characterize the local stability of the neural networks around the equilibrium. The global stability of the Hopfield neural networks is then addressed using a parameter-dependent Lyapunov function technique. All these results are shown to generalize existing results in verifying the existence/uniqueness of the equilibrium and local/global stability of Hopfield-type neural networks.},

  abstract         = {Cortical populations produce complex spatiotemporal activity spontaneously without sensory inputs. However, the fundamental computational roles of such spontaneous activity remain unclear. Here, we propose a new neural computation mechanism for understanding how spontaneous activity is actively involved in cortical processing: Computing by Modulating Spontaneous Activity (CMSA). Using biophysically plausible circuit models, we demonstrate that spontaneous activity patterns with dynamical properties, as found in empirical observations, are modulated or redistributed by external stimuli to give rise to neural responses. We find that this CMSA mechanism of generating neural responses provides profound computational advantages, such as actively speeding up cortical processing. We further reveal that the CMSA mechanism provides a unifying explanation for many experimental findings at both the single-neuron and circuit levels, and that CMSA in response to natural stimuli such as face images is the underlying neurophysiological mechanism of perceptual “bubbles” as found in psychophysical studies.},

A method for finding the optical flow pattern is presented which assumes that the apparent velocity of the brightness pattern varies smoothly almost everywhere in the image. An iterative implementation is shown which successfully computes the optical flow for a number of synthetic image sequences. The algorithm is robust in that it can handle image sequences that are quantized rather coarsely in space and time. It is also insensitive to quantization of brightness levels and additive noise. Examples are included where the assumption of smoothness is violated at singular points or along lines in the image.},

Building on this evidence, I construct a mean-field theory of active turbulence by which several measurable quantities, including the spectral densities and the correlation functions, can be analytically calculated. Because of the profound connection between the flow geometry and the topological properties of the nematic director, the theory sheds light on the mechanisms leading to the proliferation of topological defects in active nematics and provides a number of testable predictions. A hypothesis, inspired by Onsager’s statistical hydrodynamics, is finally introduced to account for the equilibrium probability distribution of the vortex sizes.},

Approximate linear representations of nonlinear dynamics have long been sought, driving considerable interest in Koopman theory. We present a universal, data-driven decomposition of chaos as an intermittently forced linear system. This work combines delay embedding and Koopman theory to decompose chaotic dynamics into a linear model in the leading delay coordinates with forcing by low-energy delay coordinates; this is called the Hankel alternative view of Koopman (HAVOK) analysis. This analysis is applied to the Lorenz system and real-world examples including Earth’s magnetic field reversal and measles outbreaks. In each case, forcing statistics are non-Gaussian, with long tails corresponding to rare intermittent forcing that precedes switching and bursting phenomena. The forcing activity demarcates coherent phase space regions where the dynamics are approximately linear from those that are strongly nonlinear.},

    abstract         = {Plasma turbulence at scales of the order of the ion inertial length is mediated by several mechanisms, including linear wave damping, magnetic reconnection, the formation and dissipation of thin current sheets, and stochastic heating. It is now understood that the presence of localized coherent structures enhances the dissipation channels and the kinetic features of the plasma. However, no formal way of quantifying the relationship between scale-to-scale energy transfer and the presence of spatial structures has been presented so far. In the Letter we quantify such a relationship analyzing the results of a two-dimensional high-resolution Hall magnetohydrodynamic simulation. In particular, we employ the technique of space filtering to derive a spectral energy flux term which defines, in any point of the computational domain, the signed flux of spectral energy across a given wave number. The characterization of coherent structures is performed by means of a traditional two-dimensional wavelet transformation. By studying the correlation between the spectral energy flux and the wavelet amplitude, we demonstrate the strong relationship between scale-to-scale transfer and coherent structures. Furthermore, by conditioning one quantity with respect to the other, we are able for the first time to quantify the inhomogeneity of the turbulence cascade induced by topological structures in the magnetic field. Taking into account the low space-filling factor of coherent structures (i.e., they cover a small portion of space), it emerges that 80\% of the spectral energy transfer (both in the direct and inverse cascade directions) is localized in about 50\% of space, and 50\% of the energy transfer is localized in only 25\% of space.},

    abstract         = {Neural field theory of the corticothalamic system is applied to predict and analyze the activity eigenmodes of the bihemispheric brain, focusing particularly on their spatial structure. The eigenmodes of a single brain hemisphere are found to be close analogs of spherical harmonics, which are the natural modes of the sphere. Instead of multiple eigenvalues being equal, as in the spherical case, cortical folding splits them to have distinct values. Inclusion of interhemispheric connections between homologous regions via the corpus callosum leads to further splitting that depends on symmetry or antisymmetry of activity between brain hemispheres, and the strength and sign of the interhemispheric connections. Symmetry properties of the lowest observed eigenmodes strongly constrain the interhemispheric connectivity strengths and unihemispheric mode spectra, and it is predicted that most spontaneous brain activity will be symmetric between hemispheres, consistent with observations. Comparison with the eigenmodes of an experimental anatomical connectivity matrix confirms these results, permits the relative strengths of intrahemispheric and interhemispheric connectivities to be approximately inferred from their eigenvalues, and lays the foundation for further experimental tests. The results are consistent with brain activity being in corticothalamic eigenmodes, rather than discrete “networks” and open the way to new approaches to brain analysis.},

  abstract         = {Interactions of large numbers of spiking neurons give rise to complex neural dynamics with fluctuations occurring at multiple scales. Understanding the dynamical mechanisms underlying such complex neural dynamics is a long-standing topic of interest in neuroscience, statistical physics and nonlinear dynamics. Conventionally, fluctuating neural dynamics are formulated as balanced, uncorrelated excitatory and inhibitory inputs with Gaussian properties. Yet heterogeneous, non-Gaussian properties have been widely observed in both neural connections and neural dynamics. Based on balanced neural networks with heterogeneous, non-Gaussian features, our analysis reveals that synaptic inputs possess power-law fluctuations in the limit of large network size, leading to a remarkable relation between complex neural dynamics and the fractional diffusion formalisms of nonequilibrium physical systems. We derive a fractional Fokker-Planck equation with analytically tractable boundary conditions for the network, uniquely accounting for the leapovers caused by the fluctuations of spiking activity. This body of formalisms represents a fractional diffusion theory of heterogeneous neural networks and results in an exact description of the network activity states. In particular, the fractional diffusion theory identifies a dynamical state at which the neural response is maximized as a function of structural connectivity. This state is then implemented in a balanced spiking neural network and displays rich, nonlinear response properties, providing a unified account of a variety of experimental findings on neural dynamics at the individual neuron and network levels, including fluctuations of membrane potentials and population firing rates. Our theory and its network implementations provide a framework for investigating complex neural dynamics emerging from large networks of spiking neurons and their functional roles in neural processing.},

Are oscillations stationary or do they form “traveling waves”, i.e., spatially organized patterns whose peaks and troughs move sequentially across cortex? Here, we show that oscillations in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) organized as traveling waves in the theta (4-8Hz), alpha (8-12Hz) and beta (12-30Hz) bands. Some traveling waves were planar but most rotated. The waves were modulated during performance of a working memory task. During baseline conditions, waves flowed bidirectionally along a specific axis of orientation. Waves in different frequency bands could travel in different directions. During task performance, there was an increase in waves in one direction over the other, especially in the beta band.},

    abstract         = {To support a range of behaviors, the brain must flexibly coordinate neural activity across widespread brain regions. One potential mechanism for this coordination is a traveling wave, in which a neural oscillation propagates across the brain while organizing the order and timing of activity across regions (Ermentrout \& Kleinfeld, 2001; Muller et al., 2018). Although traveling waves are present across the brain in various species (Lubenov \& Siapas, 2009; Zhang et al., 2018; Davis et al., 2020), their potential functional relevance remained unknown. Here, using rare direct human brain recordings, we demonstrate two novel functional roles for traveling waves of theta- and alpha-band (2-13 Hz) oscillations in the cortex. First, traveling waves propagate in different directions during separate cognitive processes. In episodic memory, traveling waves tended to propagate in posterior-to-anterior and anterior-to-posterior directions, respectively, during encoding and retrieval. Second, traveling waves are informative about the timing of behavior, with the phase of ongoing traveling waves indicating when subjects would retrieve memories. Because traveling waves of oscillations correspond to local neuronal spiking, these patterns indicate that rhythmic pulses of activity move across the brain with different directions and timing for separate behaviors. More broadly, our results suggest a fundamental role for traveling waves and oscillations in dynamically coordinating neural connectivity, by flexibly organizing the timing and directionality of network interactions across the cortex to support cognition and behavior.},

Here, using newly developed analytic techniques to characterize the moment-to-moment dynamics of noisy multielectrode data, we identify spontaneous waves of activity in the extrastriate visual cortex of awake, behaving marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). In monkeys trained to detect faint visual targets, the timing and position of spontaneous travelling waves before target onset predicted the magnitude of target-evoked activity and the likelihood of target detection. By contrast, spatially disorganized fluctuations of neural activity were much less predictive. These results reveal an important role for spontaneous travelling waves in sensory processing through the modulation of neural and perceptual sensitivity.},

                        Cells form spatial patterns by coordinating their gene expressions. How a group of mesoscopic numbers (hundreds to thousands) of cells, without pre-existing morphogen gradients and spatial organization, self-organizes spatial patterns remains poorly understood. Of particular importance are dynamic spatial patterns such as spiral waves that perpetually move and transmit information. We developed an open-source software for simulating a field of cells that communicate by secreting any number of molecules. With this software and a theory, we identified all possible “cellular dialogues”—ways of communicating with two diffusing molecules—that yield diverse dynamic spatial patterns. These patterns emerge despite widely varying responses of cells to the molecules, gene-expression noise, spatial arrangements, and cell movements. A three-stage, “order-fluctuate-settle” process forms dynamic spatial patterns: cells form long-lived whirlpools of wavelets that, following erratic dynamics, settle into a dynamic spatial pattern. Our work helps in identifying gene-regulatory networks that underlie dynamic pattern formations.},

Here, we investigate how top-down input causes frequency changes in slow oscillations during sensory processing and, in turn, how the slow oscillations are combined with fast oscillations (which encode sensory input). Using experimental connectivity patterns and strengths of interneurons, we develop a system-level model of a neuronal circuit controlling these oscillatory behaviors, allowing us to understand the mechanisms responsible for the observed oscillatory behaviors. Our analysis discovers a circuit capable of producing the observed oscillatory behaviors and finds that a detailed balance in the strength of synaptic connections is theÂ€critical determinant to produce such oscillatory behaviors. We not only uncover how disparate frequency bands are modulated and combined but also give insights into the causes of abnormal neuronal activities present in brain disorders.},

    abstract         = {Controlling arm movements requires complex, time-varying patterns of muscle activity 1,2. Accordingly, the responses of neurons in motor cortex are complex, time-varying, and heterogeneous during reaching 2–4. When examined at the population level, patterns of neural activity evolve over time according to dynamical rules 5,6. During reaching, these rules have been argued to be “rotational” 7 or variants thereof 8,9, containing coordinated oscillations in the spike rates of individual neurons. While these models capture key aspects of the neural responses, they fail to capture others – accounting for only 20-50\% of the neural response variance. Here, we consider a broader class of dynamical models. We find that motor cortex dynamics take an unexpected form: there were 3-4 rotations at fixed frequencies in M1 and {PMd} explaining more than 90\% of neural responses, but these rotations occurred in different portions of state space when movements differ. These rotations appear to reflect a curved manifold of fixed points in state space, around which dynamics are locally rotational. These fixed-frequency rotations obeyed a simple relationship with movement: the orientation of rotations in motor cortex activity were related almost linearly to the movement the animal made, allowing linear decoding of reach kinematic time-courses on single trials. This model constitutes a fundamentally novel way to consider pattern generation: like placing a record player in a large bowl, the frequency of activity is fixed, but the location of motor cortex activity on a curved manifold sets the orientation of locally-rotational dynamics. This system simplifies motor control, helps reconcile conflicting frameworks for interpreting motor cortex, and enables greatly improved neural decoding.},

    abstract         = {A general theory for two-dimensional vortex interactions is developed from the observation that, under slowly changing external influences, an individual vortex evolves through a series of equilibrium states until such a state proves unstable. Once an unstable equilibrium state is reached, a relatively fast unsteady evolution ensues, typically involving another nearby vortex. During this fast unsteady evolution, a fraction of the original coherent circulation is lost to filamentary debris, and, remarkably, the flow reorganizes into a set of quasi-steady stable vortices.The simplifying feature of the proposed theory is its use of adiabatic steadiness and marginal stability to determine the shapes and separation distance of vortices on the brink of an inelastic interaction. As a result, the parameter space for the inelastic interaction of nearby vortices is greatly reduced. In the case of two vortex patches, which is the focus of the present work, inelastic interactions depend only on a single parameter: the area ratio of the two vortices (taking the vorticity magnitude inside each to be equal). Without invoking adiabatic steadiness and marginal stability, one would have to contend with the additional parameters of vortex separation and shape, and the latter is actually an infinitude of parameters.},

Many advances have been made in understanding and controlling the defect dynamics in active6–9 and passive9,10 non-equilibrium fluids. Yet, it remains unknown whether the statistical laws that govern the dynamics of defects in classical11 or quantum fluids12–14 extend to the active matter7,15,16 and information flows17,18 in living systems. Here, we show that a defect-mediated turbulence underlies the complex wave propagation patterns of Rho-{GTP} signalling protein on the membrane of starfish egg cells, a process relevant to cytoskeletal remodelling and cell proliferation19,20. Our experiments reveal that the phase velocity field extracted from Rho-{GTP} concentration waves exhibits vortical defect motions and annihilation dynamics reminiscent of those seen in quantum systems12,13, bacterial turbulence15 and active nematics7. Several key statistics and scaling laws of the defect dynamics can be captured by a minimal Helmholtz–Onsager point vortex model21 as well as a generic complex Ginzburg–Landau22 continuum theory, suggesting a close correspondence between the biochemical signal propagation on the surface of a living cell and a widely studied class of two-dimensional turbulence23 and wave22 phenomena.},

Since flexor- and extensor-muscles alternate during movements like walking, it is often assumed that the responsible neural circuitry is similarly alternating in opposition. Here, we present ensemble-recordings of neurons in the lumbar spinal cord that indicate that, rather than alternation, the population is performing a “rotation” in neural space, i.e. the neural activity is cycling through all phases continuously during the rhythmic behavior. The radius of rotation correlates with the intended muscle force.

In the presence of force-generating active materials, these defects are able to migrate through space like swimming microorganisms. We use toroidal surfaces to show that despite their highly chaotic and non-equilibrium dynamics, pairs of defects unbind and segregate in regions of opposite Gaussian curvature. Using numerical simulations, we find that the degree of defect unbinding can be controlled by tuning the system activity, and even suppressed in strongly active systems. Furthermore, by using the defects as active microrheological tracers and quantitatively comparing our experimental and theoretical results, we are able to determine material properties of the active nematic. Our results illustrate how topology and geometry can be used to control the behaviour of active materials, and introduce a new avenue for the quantitative mechanical characterization of active fluids.},

In this paper, we consider a modification ∂tu=Δ⁢u+B̃⁡(u,u) of this equation, where B̃ is an averaged version of the bilinear operator B (where the average involves rotations, dilations, and Fourier multipliers of order zero), and which also obeys the cancellation condition ⟨B̃⁡(u,u),u⟩=0 (so that it obeys the usual energy identity). By analyzing a system of ordinary differential equations related to (but more complicated than) a dyadic Navier-Stokes model of Katz and Pavlovic, we construct an example of a smooth solution to such an averaged Navier-Stokes equation which blows up in finite time. This demonstrates that any attempt to positively resolve the Navier-Stokes global regularity problem in three dimensions has to use a finer structure on the nonlinear portion B⁡(u,u) of the equation than is provided by harmonic analysis estimates and the energy identity. We also propose a program for adapting these blowup results to the true Navier-Stokes equations.},

This neuromodulation is achieved through alterations in the biophysical properties of the neuron. However, changes in cognitive function do not arise directly from the modulation of individual neurons, but are mediated by population dynamics in mesoscopic neural ensembles. Understanding this multiscale mapping is an important but nontrivial issue. Here, we bridge these different levels of description by showing how computational models parametrically map classic neuromodulatory processes onto systems-level models of neural activity. The ensuing critical balance of systems-level activity supports perception and action, although our knowledge of this mapping remains incomplete. In this way, quantitative models that link microscale neuronal neuromodulation to systems-level brain function highlight gaps in knowledge and suggest new directions for integrating theoretical and experimental work.},

However, the essential feature of predictive coding, the notion of hierarchical depth and its neural mechanisms, remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigated the hierarchical depth of predictive auditory processing by combining functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) and high-density whole-brain electrocorticography ({ECoG}) in marmoset monkeys during an auditory local-global paradigm in which the temporal regularities of the stimuli were designed at two hierarchical levels. The prediction-errors and prediction updates were examined as neural responses to auditory mismatches and omissions. Using {fMRI}, we identified a hierarchical gradient along the auditory pathway: midbrain and sensory regions represented local, shorter-time-scale predictive processing followed by associative auditory regions, whereas anterior temporal and prefrontal areas represented global, longer-time-scale sequence processing. The complementary {ECoG} recordings confirmed the activations at cortical surface areas and further differentiated the signals of prediction-error and update, which were transmitted via putative bottom-up γ and top-down β oscillations, respectively. Furthermore, omission responses caused by absence of input, reflecting solely the two levels of prediction signals that are unique to the hierarchical predictive coding framework, demonstrated the hierarchical top-down process of predictions in the auditory, temporal, and prefrontal areas. Thus, our findings support the hierarchical predictive coding framework, and outline how neural networks and spatiotemporal dynamics are used to represent and arrange a hierarchical structure of auditory sequences in the marmoset brain.},

Decoding of inherent information in brain signals to interpret the user’s intention is one of main approaches for developing {BMI} technology. Subdural electrocorticography ({sECoG})-based decoding provides good accuracy, but surgical complications are one of the major concerns for this approach to be applied in {BMIs}. In contrast, epidural electrocorticography ({eECoG}) is less invasive, thus it is theoretically more suitable for long-term implementation, although it is unclear whether {eECoG} signals carry sufficient information for decoding natural movements. We successfully decoded continuous three-dimensional hand trajectories from {eECoG} signals in Japanese macaques. A steady quantity of information of continuous hand movements could be acquired from the decoding system for at least several months, and a decoding model could be used for ∼10 days without significant degradation in accuracy or recalibration. The correlation coefficients between observed and predicted trajectories were lower than those for {sECoG}-based decoding experiments we previously reported, owing to a greater degree of chewing artifacts in {eECoG}-based decoding than is found in {sECoG}-based decoding. As one of the safest invasive recording methods available, {eECoG} provides an acceptable level of performance. With the ease of replacement and upgrades, {eECoG} systems could become the first-choice interface for real-life {BMI} applications.},

Noise-induced self-pulsations are documented by distinct Lorentzian-like features in the power spectrum. The character of coherence is critically related to the type of the bifurcation. In the supercritical case, spectral width and height of the peak are monotonic functions of the noise level. In contrast, for the subcritical bifurcation, the width exhibits a minimum, translating into resonance behavior of the correlation time in the pulsation transients. A theoretical analysis based on the generic model of a self-sustained oscillator demonstrates that these observations are of general nature and are related to the fact that the damping depends qualitatively different on the noise intensity for the subcritical and supercritical case.},

    abstract         = {The technology, methodology and models used by visual neuroscientists have provided great insights into the structure and function of individual brain areas. However, complex cognitive functions arise in the brain due to networks comprising multiple interacting cortical areas that are wired together with precise anatomical connections. A prime example of this phenomenon is the frontal–parietal network and two key regions within it: the frontal eye fields ({FEF}) and lateral intraparietal area (area {LIP}). Activity in these cortical areas has independently been tied to oculomotor control, motor preparation, visual attention and decision-making. Strong, bidirectional anatomical connections have also been traced between {FEF} and area {LIP}, suggesting that the aforementioned visual functions depend on these inter-area interactions. However, advancements in our knowledge about the interactions between area {LIP} and {FEF} are limited with the main animal model, the rhesus macaque, because these key regions are buried in the sulci of the brain. In this review, we propose that the common marmoset is the ideal model for investigating how anatomical connections give rise to functionally-complex cognitive visual behaviours, such as those modulated by the frontal–parietal network, because of the homology of their cortical networks with humans and macaques, amenability to transgenic technology, and rich behavioural repertoire. Furthermore, the lissencephalic structure of the marmoset brain enables application of powerful techniques, such as array-based electrophysiology and optogenetics, which are critical to bridge the gaps in our knowledge about structure and function in the brain.},

However, the spatiotemporal organization properties and principles of this intrinsic activity have only been partially elucidated because of previous poor resolution of experimental data and limited analysis methods. Here we investigated continuous wave patterns in the 0.5–4 Hz (delta band) frequency range on data from high-spatiotemporal resolution optical voltage imaging of the upper cortical layers in anesthetized mice. Waves of population activities propagate in heterogeneous directions to coordinate neuronal activities between different brain regions. The complex wave patterns show characteristics of both stereotypy and variety. The location and type of wave patterns determine the dynamical evolution when different waves interact with each other. Local wave patterns of source, sink, or saddle emerge at preferred spatial locations. Specifically, “source” patterns are predominantly found in cortical regions with low multimodal hierarchy such as the primary somatosensory cortex. Our findings reveal principles that govern the spatiotemporal dynamics of spontaneous cortical activities and associate them with the structural architecture across the cortex.
                        {SIGNIFICANCE} {STATEMENT} Intrinsic brain activities, as opposed to external stimulus-evoked responses, have increasingly gained attention, but it remains unclear how these intrinsic activities are spatiotemporally organized at the cortex-wide scale. By taking advantage of the high spatiotemporal resolution of optical voltage imaging, we identified five wave pattern types, and revealed the organization properties of different wave patterns and the dynamical mechanisms when they interact with each other. Moreover, we found a relationship between the emergence probability of local wave patterns and the multimodal structure hierarchy across cortical areas. Our findings reveal the principles of spatiotemporal wave dynamics of spontaneous activities and associate them with the underlying hierarchical architecture across the cortex.},

    abstract         = {Consciousness is an emergent property of the complex brain network. In order to understand how consciousness is constructed, neural interactions within this network must be elucidated. Previous studies have shown that specific neural interactions between the thalamus and frontoparietal cortices; frontal and parietal cortices; and parietal and temporal cortices are correlated with levels of consciousness. However, due to technical limitations, the network underlying consciousness has not been investigated in terms of large-scale interactions with high temporal and spectral resolution. In this study, we recorded neural activity with dense electrocorticogram ({ECoG}) arrays and used the spectral Granger causality to generate a more comprehensive network that relates to consciousness in monkeys. We found that neural interactions were significantly different between conscious and unconscious states in all combinations of cortical region pairs. Furthermore, the difference in neural interactions between conscious and unconscious states could be represented in 4 frequency-specific large-scale networks with unique interaction patterns: 2 networks were related to consciousness and showed peaks in alpha and beta bands, while the other 2 networks were related to unconsciousness and showed peaks in theta and gamma bands. Moreover, networks in the unconscious state were shared amongst 3 different unconscious conditions, which were induced either by ketamine and medetomidine, propofol, or sleep. Our results provide a novel picture that the difference between conscious and unconscious states is characterized by a switch in frequency-specific modes of large-scale communications across the entire cortex, rather than the cessation of interactions between specific cortical regions.},

Here, we report cerebral neural dynamics during active visual exploration recorded by an electrocorticographic array covering the entire lateral surface of the marmoset cortex. We found that the dorsal stream was activated before the primary visual cortex with saccades and followed by the alteration of suppression and activation signals along the ventral stream. Similarly, the signal that propagated from the dorsal to ventral visual areas was accompanied by a travelling wave of low frequency oscillations. Such signal dynamics occurred at an average of 220 ms after saccades, which corresponded to the timing when whole-brain activation returned to background levels. We also demonstrated that saccades could occur at any point of signal flow, indicating the parallel computation of motor commands. Overall, this study reveals the neural dynamics of active vision, which are efficiently linked to the natural rhythms of visual exploration.},

With the growing success of deep learning, which utilizes brain-inspired architectures, these three designed components have increasingly become central to how we model, engineer and optimize complex artificial learning systems. Here we argue that a greater focus on these components would also benefit systems neuroscience.

In the cortex, synapses are embedded within multilayered networks, making it difficult to determine the effect of an individual synaptic modification on the behaviour of the system. The backpropagation algorithm solves this problem in deep artificial neural networks, but historically it has been viewed as biologically problematic. Nonetheless, recent developments in neuroscience and the successes of artificial neural networks have reinvigorated interest in whether backpropagation offers insights for understanding learning in the cortex. The backpropagation algorithm learns quickly by computing synaptic updates using feedback connections to deliver error signals. Although feedback connections are ubiquitous in the cortex, it is difficult to see how they could deliver the error signals required by strict formulations of backpropagation. Here we build on past and recent developments to argue that feedback connections may instead induce neural activities whose differences can be used to locally approximate these signals and hence drive effective learning in deep networks in the brain.},

Does the brain use similar brute-force fitting processes to learn how to perceive and act upon the world? Recent advances in artificial neural networks have exposed the power of optimizing millions of synaptic weights over millions of observations to operate robustly in real-world contexts. These models do not learn simple, human-interpretable rules or representations of the world; rather, they use local computations to interpolate over task-relevant manifolds in a high-dimensional parameter space. Counterintuitively, similar to evolutionary processes, over-parameterized models can be simple and parsimonious, as they provide a versatile, robust solution for learning a diverse set of functions. This new family of direct-fit models present a radical challenge to many of the theoretical assumptions in psychology and neuroscience. At the same time, this shift in perspective establishes unexpected links with developmental and ecological psychology.},

    abstract         = {A new method for analysing nonlinear and non-stationary data has been developed. The key part of the method is the ‘empirical mode decomposition’ method with which any complicated data set can be decomposed into a finite and often small number of ‘intrinsic mode functions’ that admit well-behaved Hilbert transforms. This decomposition method is adaptive, and, therefore, highly efficient. Since the decomposition is based on the local characteristic time scale of the data, it is applicable to nonlinear and non-stationary processes. With the Hilbert transform, the ‘instrinic mode functions’ yield instantaneous frequencies as functions of time that give sharp identifications of imbedded structures. The final presentation of the results is an energy-frequency-time distribution, designated as the Hilbert spectrum. In this method, the main conceptual innovations are the introduction of ‘intrinsic mode functions’ based on local properties of the signal, which make the instantaneous frequency meaningful; and the introduction of the instantaneous frequencies for complicated data sets, which eliminate the need for spurious harmonics to represent nonlinear and non-stationary signals. Examples from the numerical results of the classical nonlinear equation systems and data representing natural phenomena are given to demonstrate the power of this new method. Classical nonlinear system data are especially interesting, for they serve to illustrate the roles played by the nonlinear and non-stationary effects in the energy-frequency-time distribution.},

In rodents, phase-locked firing during spindles may facilitate spike-timing-dependent plasticity by grouping pre-then-post-synaptic cell firing within {\textasciitilde}25 ms. Currently, microphysiological evidence in humans for conditions conducive for spike-timing-dependent plasticity during spindles is absent. Here, we analyze field potentials and unit firing from middle/upper layers during spindles from 10 × 10 microelectrode arrays at 400 μm pitch in humans. We report strong tonic and phase-locked increases in firing and co-firing within 25 ms during spindles, especially those co-occurring with down-to-upstate transitions. Co-firing, spindle co-occurrence, and spindle coherence are greatest within {\textasciitilde}2 mm, and high co-firing of units on different contacts depends on high spindle coherence between those contacts. Spindles propagate at {\textasciitilde}0.28 m/s in distinct patterns, with correlated cell co-firing sequences. Spindles hence organize spatiotemporal patterns of neuronal co-firing in ways that may provide pre-conditions for plasticity during non-rapid eye movement sleep.},

In this paper, we aim to predict turbulent flow by learning its highly nonlinear dynamics from spatiotemporal velocity fields of large-scale fluid flow simulations of relevance to turbulence modeling and climate modeling. We adopt a hybrid approach by marrying two well-established turbulent flow simulation techniques with deep learning. Specifically, we introduce trainable spectral filters in a coupled model of Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes ({RANS}) and Large Eddy Simulation ({LES}), followed by a specialized U-net for prediction. Our approach, which we call turbulent-Flow Net ({TF}-Net), is grounded in a principled physics model, yet offers the flexibility of learned representations. We compare our model, {TF}-Net, with state-of-the-art baselines and observe significant reductions in error for predictions 60 frames ahead. Most importantly, our method predicts physical fields that obey desirable physical characteristics, such as conservation of mass, whilst faithfully emulating the turbulent kinetic energy field and spectrum, which are critical for accurate prediction of turbulent flows.},

Despite a plethora of methods having been proposed for the analysis of multivariate time series, most of them do not investigate whether signals result from independent, pairwise, or group interactions. Here, we propose a novel framework to characterize the temporal evolution of higher-order dependencies within multivariate time series. Using network analysis and topology, we show that, unlike traditional tools, our framework robustly differentiates various spatiotemporal regimes of coupled chaotic maps, including chaotic dynamical phases and various types of synchronization. By analysing {fMRI} signals, we find that, during rest, the human brain mainly oscillates between chaotic and few partially intermittent states, with higher-order structures reflecting sensorimotor areas. Similarly, in financial and epidemic time series, instead, higher-order information efficiently discriminates between radically different coordination and spreading regimes. Overall, our approach sheds new light on the higher-order organization of multivariate time series, allowing for a better characterization of dynamical group dependencies inherent to real-world systems.},

Using this method, adjacent auditory, visual, and somatosensory cortices are noninvasively parcellated in individual subjects with detailed tonotopy, retinotopy, and somatotopy. An additional pure-tone-responsive tonotopic gradient is discovered in auditory cortex and a face-patch sensitive to motion in the lower-center visual field is localized near an auditory region representing frequencies of conspecific vocalizations. This through-skull landscape-mapping approach provides new opportunities for understanding how the primate cortex is organized and coordinated to enable real-world behaviors.},

    abstract         = {The use of surrogate data has become a crucial first step in the study of nonlinearity in time series data. A widely used technique to construct surrogate data is to randomize the phases of the data in the Fourier domain. In this paper, an alternative technique based on the resampling of wavelet coefficients is discussed. This approach exploits between scale correlations that exist within nonlinear data but which are either absent or weak in stochastic data. It proceeds by transforming the data into the wavelet domain and permuting the wavelet coefficients. Experimental and numerical time series data are used to demonstrate that the performance of the wavelet resampling technique is comparable to phase randomization in terms of the preservation of linear properties, removal of nonlinear structure and computational demands. However, the wavelet technique may have specific and distinct advantages in the application to complex data sets, such as numerical analysis of turbulence and experimental brain imaging data, where wavelets give a more parsimonious representation of spatio-temporal patterns than Fourier modes. It is shown that different techniques of resampling the data in the wavelet domain may optimize the construction of surrogate data according to the properties of the experimental time series and computational constraints.},

    abstract         = {Objectives: This study examines human scalp electroencephalographic ({EEG}) data for evidence of non-linear interdependence between posterior channels. The spectral and phase properties of those epochs of {EEG} exhibiting non-linear interdependence are studied. Methods: Scalp {EEG} data was collected from 40 healthy subjects. A technique for the detection of non-linear interdependence was applied to 2.048s segments of posterior bipolar electrode data. Amplitude-adjusted phase-randomized surrogate data was used to statistically determine which {EEG} epochs exhibited non-linear interdependence. Results: Statistically significant evidence of non-linear interactions were evident in 2.9\% (eyes open) to 4.8\% (eyes closed) of the epochs. In the eyes-open recordings, these epochs exhibited a peak in the spectral and cross-spectral density functions at about 10Hz. Two types of {EEG} epochs are evident in the eyes-closed recordings; one type exhibits a peak in the spectral density and cross-spectrum at 8Hz. The other type has increased spectral and cross-spectral power across faster frequencies. Epochs identified as exhibiting non-linear interdependence display a tendency towards phase interdependencies across and between a broad range of frequencies. Conclusions: Non-linear interdependence is detectable in a small number of multichannel {EEG} epochs, and makes a contribution to the alpha rhythm. Non-linear interdependence produces spatially distributed activity that exhibits phase synchronization between oscillations present at different frequencies. The possible physiological significance of these findings are discussed with reference to the dynamical properties of neural systems and the role of synchronous activity in the neocortex.},

In such circumstances, a framework for statistical hypothesis testing is necessary but the nonlinear nature of the phenomena studied makes the formulation of standard hypothesis tests, such as analysis of variance, problematic as they are based on underlying linear, Gaussian assumptions. One approach to this problem is the method of surrogate data, which is the technique explained in this paper. In particular, we focus on (i) hypothesis testing for nonlinearity by generating linearized surrogates as a null hypothesis, (ii) a variant of this that is perhaps more appropriate for image data where structural nonlinearities are common and should be retained in the surrogates, and (iii) gradual reconstruction where we systematically constrain the surrogates until there is no significant difference between data and surrogates and use this to understand geophysical processes. In addition to time series of sunspot activity, solutions to the Lorenz equations, and spatial maps of enstrophy in a turbulent channel flow, two examples are considered in detail. The first concerns gradual wavelet reconstruction testing of the significance of a specific vortical flow structure from turbulence time series acquired at a point. In the second, the degree of nonlinearity in the spatial profiles of river curvature is shown to be affected by the occurrence of meander cutoff processes but in a more complex fashion than previously envisaged.},

Our algorithm is similar in principle to well-known algorithms based on the preservation of the Fourier amplitude spectrum and original values of a time series. However, it is underpinned by a dual-tree complex wavelet transform rather than a Fourier transform. Our method, which we term the iterated amplitude adjusted wavelet transform can be used to generate bootstrapped versions of multifractal data, and because it preserves the pointwise Hölder regularity but not the local Hölder regularity, it can be used to test hypotheses concerning the presence of oscillating singularities in a time series, an important feature of turbulence and econophysics data. Because the locations of the data values are randomized with respect to the multifractal structure, hypotheses about their mutual coupling can be tested, which is important for the velocity-intermittency structure of turbulence and self-regulating processes.},

We report on a new open access template of the marmoset cortex (the Nencki–Monash, or {NM} template), representing a morphological average of 20 brains of young adult individuals, obtained by 3D reconstructions generated from Nissl-stained serial sections. The method used to generate the template takes into account morphological features of the individual brains, as well as the borders of clearly defined cytoarchitectural areas. This has resulted in a resource which allows direct estimates of the most likely coordinates of each cortical area, as well as quantification of the margins of error involved in assigning voxels to areas, and preserves quantitative information about the laminar structure of the cortex. We provide spatial transformations between the {NM} and other available marmoset brain templates, thus enabling integration with magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) and tracer-based connectivity data. The {NM} template combines some of the main advantages of histology-based atlases (e.g. information about the cytoarchitectural structure) with features more commonly associated with {MRI}-based templates (isotropic nature of the dataset, and probabilistic analyses). The underlying workflow may be found useful in the future development of 3D brain atlases that incorporate information about the variability of areas in species for which it may be impractical to ensure homogeneity of the sample in terms of age, sex and genetic background.},

    abstract         = {Populations of cortical neurons generate rhythmic fluctuations in their ongoing spontaneous activity. These fluctuations can be seen in the local field potential ({LFP}), which reflects summed return currents from synaptic activity in the local population near a recording electrode. The {LFP} is spectrally broad and many researchers view this breadth as containing many narrowband oscillatory components which may have distinct functional roles. This view is supported by the observation that the phase of narrowband oscillations are often correlated with cortical excitability and can relate to the timing of spiking activity and the fidelity of sensory evoked responses. Accordingly, researchers commonly “tune in'' to these channels by narrowband filtering the {LFP}. Alternatively, neural activity may be fundamentally broadband and composed of transient, non-stationary rhythms that are difficult to approximate as oscillations. In this view, the instantaneous state of the broad ensemble relates directly to the excitability of the local population with no particular allegiance to any frequency band. To test between these alternatives, we asked whether the spiking activity of neocortical neurons in marmoset of either sex is better aligned with the phase of the {LFP} within narrow frequency bands, or with a broadband measure. We find that the phase of broadband {LFP} fluctuations provides a better predictor of spike timing than the phase after filtering in narrow bands. These results challenge the view of the neocortex as a system composed of narrow-band oscillators, and supports a view in which neural activity fluctuations are intrinsically broadband.
                        Significance Statement:
                        Research into the dynamical state of neural populations often attribute unique significance to the state of narrowband oscillatory components. However, rhythmic fluctuations in cortical activity are non-stationary and broad spectrum. We find that the timing of spontaneous spiking activity is better captured by the state of broadband fluctuations over any latent oscillatory component. These results suggest narrowband interpretations of rhythmic population activity may be limited, and broader representations may provide higher fidelity in describing moment-to-moment fluctuations in cortical activity.},

Nonetheless, it remains unclear how one should test hypotheses focused on the overlap or spatial correspondence between two or more brain maps. This “correspondence problem” affects, for example, the interpretation of comparisons between task-based patterns of functional activation, resting-state networks or modules, and neuroanatomical landmarks. To date, this problem has been addressed with remarkable variability in terms of methodological approaches and statistical rigor. In this paper, we address the correspondence problem using a spatial permutation framework to generate null models of overlap by applying random rotations to spherical representations of the cortical surface, an approach for which we also provide a theoretical statistical foundation. We use this method to derive clusters of cognitive functions that are correlated in terms of their functional neuroatomical substrates. In addition, using publicly available data, we formally demonstrate the correspondence between maps of task-based functional activity, resting-state {fMRI} networks and gyral-based anatomical landmarks. We provide open-access code to implement the methods presented for two commonly-used tools for surface based cortical analysis (https://www.github.com/spin-test). This spatial permutation approach constitutes a useful advance over widely-used methods for the comparison of cortical maps, thereby opening new possibilities for the integration of diverse neuroimaging data.},

    abstract         = {A fundamental question in neuroscience is whether and how the brain’s molecular, cellular and cytoarchitectonic properties govern its inter-regional structural connectivity. Several recent studies have leveraged spatial transcriptomic data to infer the mouse mesoscale connectome with high accuracy, indicating that there is a strong biological link between whole-brain gene expression and inter-regional connectivity. However, despite the fact that cells are the fundamental biological units forming and maintaining white-matter tracts, the question of whether and which regional cell-type distributions determine patterns of structural connectivity, has received scant attention. Such a link has been previously postulated, but the lack of a comprehensive spatial atlas of cell types in the mouse brain has prevented its direct investigation. Here, we utilize recent advances in whole-brain mapping of a variety of neuronal and non-neuronal subtypes using the Matrix Inversion and Subset Selection ({MISS}) algorithm to model inter-regional connectivity as a function of regional cell-type composition with various machine learning approaches. Of the different machine learning models we tried, the random forest algorithm was the only method to give excellent performance at predicting both the binary existence or absence of a connection and the connectivity density between region-pairs. Moreover, using feature importance analysis, we found that oligodendrocytes and endothelial cells were the most salient for reconstructing the whole-brain connectome and correlated strongly with several node-level connectome graph metrics. We also found that layer-specific excitatory neurons contributed most for predicting long-range connectivity, while several interneuron subtypes were highly informative for predicting short-range connectivity. Prediction accuracy was similar across two independently sampled sets of cell types, indicating that cell-type distributions are a robust predictor of inter-regional connectivity. Taken together, our results provide the first demonstration of a link between whole-brain cell-type distributions and the structural connections between regions, and provide a road map for examining this relationship in other species, including humans.},

Standard methods of dimensionality reduction excel at finding global low-dimensional structure, but do not provide crucial fine-grained information about how the dynamics of individual neural elements change over time. Univariate time-series features can measure the dynamical properties of local neural elements, but most assume stationary data in which dynamical properties are constant. We present a new method that combines time-series features with dimensionality reduction to: i) produce interpretable, time-resolved summaries of non-stationary data; then ii) infer the parametric variation undboierlying non-stationarity in complex neural dynamics. As a case study, we investigated neural responses to visual stimuli using the Allen Neuropixels dataset, a spatio-temporal set of electrophysiological recordings from the mouse brain. Our method automatically reveals channels that transition between states with distinct patterns of activity as a visual stimulus changes over time. In a single subject, we temporally resolve the dynamical regimes of regions such as the primary visual cortex and lateral posterior nucleus, which include slow, periodic theta oscillations and higher-frequency broadband fluctuations, without aggregating local readings over imposed anatomical divisions. Unlike conventional approaches to dimensionality reduction, our new method: i) does not require phase-synchronized time series; ii) produces an informative low-dimensional representation of complex dynamics, resolved over space and time; and iii) can be directly interpreted in terms of the dynamical properties encapsulated by each feature, without needing to identify a model for the underlying system. Our approach can be applied to many forms of spatio-temporal neural data to understand how the dynamics of neural components respond to changes in the environment.},

One notable tool for extending conventional signal-processing operations to networks is the graph Fourier transform that can be obtained as the eigendecomposition of the graph Laplacian. In this letter, we used the graph Fourier transform to define a new method for generating surrogate graph signals. The approach is based on sign-randomization of the graph Fourier coefficients and, therefore, the correlation structure of the surrogate graph signals (i.e., smoothness on the graph topology) is imposed by the measured data. The proposed method of surrogate data generation can be widely applied for nonparametric statistical hypothesis testing. Here, we showed a proof-of-concept with a high-density electroencephalography dataset.},

In this paper, we propose a new method which considers the graph Fourier transform. In this manner, much more flexibility is gained to define properties of the original graph signal which are to be preserved in the surrogates. The complex case is considered to allow unconstrained phase randomization in the transformed domain, hence we define a Hermitian Laplacian matrix that models the graph topology, whose eigenvectors form the basis of a complex graph Fourier transform. We have shown that the Hermitian Laplacian matrix may have negative eigenvalues. We also show in the paper that preserving the graph spectrum amplitude implies several invariances that can be controlled by the selected Hermitian Laplacian matrix. The interest of surrogating graph signals has been illustrated in the context of scarcity of instances in classifier training.},

This research has demonstrated that non-conscious dynamics tend to be more synchronous than in conscious states, which are more asynchronous. Here we go beyond this dichotomy to demonstrate that different brain states are underpinned by dissociable spatiotemporal dynamics. We investigated human neuroimaging data from different brain states (resting state, meditation, deep sleep and disorders of consciousness after coma). The model-free approach was based on Kuramoto’s turbulence framework using coupled oscillators. This was extended by a measure of the information cascade across spatial scales. Complementarily, the model-based approach used exhaustive in silico perturbations of whole-brain models fitted to these measures. This allowed studying of the information encoding capabilities in given brain states. Overall, this framework demonstrates that elements from turbulence theory provide excellent tools for describing and differentiating between brain states.},

Large ecosystem changes such as eutrophication, shifts among vegetation types, degradation of coral reefs and regional climate change often come as surprises because we lack leading indicators for regime shifts. Increases in variability of ecosystems have been suggested to foreshadow ecological regime shifts. However, it may be difficult to discern variability due to impending regime shift from that of exogenous drivers that affect the ecosystem. We addressed this problem using a model of lake eutrophication. Lakes are subject to fluctuations in recycling associated with regime shifts, as well as fluctuating nutrient inputs. Despite the complications of noisy inputs, increasing variability of lake-water phosphorus was discernible prior to the shift to eutrophic conditions. Simulations show that rising standard deviation ({SD}) could signal impending shifts about a decade in advance. The rising {SD} was detected by studying variability around predictions of a simple time-series model, and did not depend on detailed knowledge of the actual ecosystem dynamics.},

The usual technique to generate power-law distributed data is to first infer the scale exponent α using the observed data of interest and then sample from the associated distribution. This approach has important limitations because it relies on a fixed α (e.g., it has limited applicability in testing the family of power-law distributions) and on the hypothesis of independent observations (e.g., it ignores temporal correlations and other constraints typically present in complex systems data). Here we propose a constrained surrogate method that overcomes these limitations by choosing uniformly at random from a set of sequences exactly as likely to be observed under a discrete power law as the original sequence (i.e., regardless of α) and by showing how additional constraints can be imposed in the sequence (e.g., the Markov transition probability between states). This nonparametric approach involves redistributing observed prime factors to randomize values in accordance with a power-law model but without restricting ourselves to independent observations or to a particular α. We test our results in simulated and real data, ranging from the intensity of earthquakes to the number of fatalities in disasters.},

Since {NMDA} receptor antagonists induce cognitive impairments, ketamine has been used for translational research on several psychiatric diseases, such as schizophrenia. Whereas the effects of ketamine on cognitive functions have been extensively studied, studies on the effects of ketamine on simple sensory information processing remain limited. In this study, we investigated the cortex-wide effects of ketamine administration on auditory information processing in nonhuman primates using whole-cortical electrocorticography ({ECoG}). We first recorded {ECoG} from awake monkeys on presenting auditory stimuli of different frequencies or different durations. We observed auditory evoked responses ({AERs}) across the cortex, including in frontal, parietal, and temporal areas, while feature-specific responses were obtained around the temporal sulcus. Next, we examined the effects of ketamine on cortical auditory information processing. We conducted {ECoG} recordings from monkeys that had been administered anesthetic doses of ketamine from 10 to 180 min following administration. We observed significant changes in stimulus feature-specific responses. Electrodes showing a frequency preference or offset responses were altered following ketamine administration, while those of the {AERs} were not strongly influenced. However, the frequency preference of a selected electrode was not significantly altered by ketamine administration over time following administration, while the imbalances in the onset and offset persisted over the course of 150 min following ketamine administration in all three monkeys. These results suggest that ketamine affects the ability to distinguish between sound frequency and duration in different ways. In conclusion, future research on the {NMDA} sensitivity of cortical wide sensory information processing may provide a new perspective into the development of nonhuman primate models of psychiatric disorders.},

By momentarily silencing one area while recording activity in the other, we find that both areas reliably affected changing subpopulations of target neurons within one hundred milliseconds while mice observed a visual stimulus. The influence of {LM} feedback on V1 responses became even more dynamic when the visual stimuli predicted a reward, causing fast changes in the geometry of V1 population activity and affecting stimulus coding in a context-dependent manner. Therefore, the functional interactions between cortical areas are not static but unfold through rapidly shifting communication subspaces whose dynamics depend on context when processing sensory information.},

For instance, visual processing in primates requires the appropriate relaying of signals across many distinct cortical areas. Yet our understanding of how populations of neurons in interconnected brain areas communicate is in its infancy. Here we investigate how trial-to-trial fluctuations of population responses in primary visual cortex (V1) are related to simultaneously recorded population responses in area V2. Using dimensionality reduction methods, we find that V1-V2 interactions occur through a communication subspace: V2 fluctuations are related to a small subset of V1 population activity patterns, distinct from the largest fluctuations shared among neurons within V1. In contrast, interactions between subpopulations within V1 are less selective. We propose that the communication subspace may be a general, population-level mechanism by which activity can be selectively routed across brain areas.},

    abstract         = {I propose that synchronization affects communication between neuronal groups. Gamma-band (30–90 Hz) synchronization modulates excitation rapidly enough that it escapes the following inhibition and activates postsynaptic neurons effectively. Synchronization also ensures that a presynaptic activation pattern arrives at postsynaptic neurons in a temporally coordinated manner. At a postsynaptic neuron, multiple presynaptic groups converge, e.g., representing different stimuli. If a stimulus is selected by attention, its neuronal representation shows stronger and higher-frequency gamma-band synchronization. Thereby, the attended stimulus representation selectively entrains postsynaptic neurons. The entrainment creates sequences of short excitation and longer inhibition that are coordinated between pre- and postsynaptic groups to transmit the attended representation and shut out competing inputs. The predominantly bottom-up-directed gamma-band influences are controlled by predominantly top-down-directed alpha-beta-band (8–20 Hz) influences. Attention itself samples stimuli at a 7–8 Hz theta rhythm. Thus, several rhythms and their interplay render neuronal communication effective, precise, and selective.},

    abstract         = {A range of perceptual and cognitive processes have been characterized from the perspective of probabilistic representations and inference. To understand the neural circuit mechanism underlying these probabilistic computations, we develop a new theory based on complex spatiotemporal dynamics of neural population activity. We first implement and explore this theory in a biophysically realistic, spiking neural circuit. Population activity patterns emerging from the circuit capture the realistic variability or fluctuations of neural dynamics not only in time but also in space; such spatial fluctuations, however, are ignored in traditional models of neural computations. These activity patterns implement a new type of probabilistic computations that we call Fractional Neural Sampling ({FNS}). We further develop a normative model to reveal the algorithmic nature of {FNS} and its powerful computational advantages for representing multimodal distributions, a major challenge faced by existing theories. We show that {FNS} accounts for recent experimental observations of perceptual inference and makes experimentally testable predictions.},

To integrate these properties from anatomy and physiology, and to elucidate the links between them, we develop a novel cortical circuit model that captures a range of realistic features of synaptic connectivity. We show that the model accounts for the emergence of higher-order connectivity structures, including highly connected hub neurons that form an interconnected rich-club. The circuit model exhibits a rich repertoire of dynamical activity states, ranging from asynchronous to localized and global propagating wave states. We find that around the transition between asynchronous and localized propagating wave states, our model quantitatively reproduces a variety of major empirical findings regarding neural spatiotemporal dynamics, which otherwise remain disjointed in existing studies. These dynamics include diverse coupling (correlation) between spiking activity of individual neurons and the population, dynamical wave patterns with variable speeds and precise temporal structures of neural spikes. We further illustrate how these neural dynamics are related to the connectivity properties by analysing structural contributions to variable spiking dynamics and by showing that the rich-club structure is related to the diverse population coupling. These findings establish an integrated account of structural connectivity and activity dynamics of local cortical circuits, and provide new insights into understanding their working mechanisms.},

We aimed to study the relation between interactions among multiple areas, and if they are fixed or dynamic. The structural connectivity provides a substrate for these interactions, but anatomical connectivity is not known in sufficient detail and it only gives us a static picture. Using the Allen Brain Observatory Visual Coding Neuropixels dataset, which includes simultaneous recordings of spiking activity from up to 6 hierarchically organized mouse cortical visual areas, we estimate the functional connectivity between neurons using a linear model of responses to flashed static grating stimuli. We characterize functional connectivity between populations via interaction subspaces. We find that distinct subspaces of a source area mediate interactions with distinct target areas, supporting the notion that cortical areas use distinct channels to communicate. Most importantly, using a piecewise linear model for activity within each trial, we find that these interactions evolve dynamically over tens of milliseconds following a stimulus presentation. Inter-areal subspaces become more aligned with the intra-areal subspaces during epochs in which a feedforward wave of activity propagates through visual cortical areas. When the short-term dynamics are averaged over, we find that the interaction subspaces are stable over multiple stimulus blocks. These findings have important implications for understanding how information flows through biological neural networks composed of interconnected modules, each of which may have a distinct functional specialization.},

Here, we demonstrate a novel analytical method to track network events underlying state-dependent β- (15-30Hz) and γ- (30-80Hz) range activity in mouse primary visual cortex (V1). We find that γ events are selectively associated with enhanced visual encoding by V1 neurons and γ event rate increases prior to visually-cued behavior, accurately predicting single trial visual detection. This relationship between γ events and behavior is sensory modality-specific and rapidly modulated by changes in task objectives. These findings illuminate a distinct role for transient patterns of cortical activity, indicating that γ supports flexible encoding according to behavioral context.},

It has been suggested that gamma power indicates the strength of neuronal population synchrony, which influences the relaying of signals between cortical areas. However, the relationship between coordinated spiking activity and gamma remains unclear, and the influence on corticocortical signaling largely untested. We investigated these issues by recording from neuronal populations in areas V1 and V2 of anesthetized macaque monkeys. We found that visual stimuli that induce a strong, coherent gamma rhythm result in enhanced pairwise and higher-order V1 synchrony. This is associated with stronger coupling of V1-V2 spiking activity, in a retinotopically specific manner. Coupling is more strongly related to the gamma modulation of V1 firing than to the downstream V2 rhythm. Our results thus show that elevated gamma power is associated with stronger coordination of spiking activity both within and between cortical areas.},

An arrow diagram (vectors indicating receptive field centers placed at cortical coordinates) provides a more compact and understandable representation of retinotopy than does a standard receptive field chart (accompanied by a penetration map) or a double contour map (e.g., isoeccentricity and isopolar angle as a function of cortical x, y-coordinates). None of these three representational techniques, however, make separate areas easily visible, especially in data sets containing numerous areas with partial, distorted representations of the visual hemifield. Therefore, we computed visual field sign maps (non-mirror-image vs mirror-image visual field representation) from the angle between the direction of the cortical gradient in receptive field eccentricity and the cortical gradient in receptive field angle for each small region of the cortex. Visual field sign is a local measure invariant to cortical map orientation and distortion but also to choice of receptive field coordinate system. To estimate the gradients, we first interpolated the eccentricity and polar angle data onto regular grids using a distance-weighted smoothing algorithm. The visual field sign technique provides a more objective method for using retinotopy to outline multiple visual areas. In order to relate these arrow and visual field sign maps accurately to architectonic features visualized in the stained, flattened cortex, we also developed a deformable template algorithm for warping the photograph-derived penetration map using the final observed location of a set of marking lesions.},

Our method accurately tracks a broad variety of non-stationarities in a range of simulated test systems, where non-stationarity was controlled by ground-truth parameter values. I will also show how we analyse high-dimensional, spatio-temporal Neuropixels recordings to automatically uncover regions of the brain that transition between distinct dynamical states as environmental parameters change over time.

    abstract         = {Uncovering the patterns buried in high-dimensional spatio-temporal data is vital for investigating how environmental parameters translate to complex neuronal activity. Standard methods of dimensionality reduction excel at finding global low-dimensional structure, but do not provide crucial fine-grained information about how the dynamics of individual neural elements change over time. As an alternative, univariate time-series features measure the dynamical properties of local neural elements, but most assume stationary data in which dynamical properties are constant. We present a new method that combines time-series features with dimensionality reduction to produce interpretable, time-resolved summaries of non-stationary data. By exploiting the correspondence between parameters and dynamics [1], we are then able to infer the parametric variation underlying non-stationarity in complex neural dynamics.
                        Our method (Fig. 1) first applies feature extraction [2] to windows of a time series, yielding a feature matrix that measures dynamical properties across time. We then infer parametric variation by applying dimensionality reduction to the feature matrix, extracting the trajectory of local time-series windows through a low-dimensional feature space. To ensure our feature-space embedding is unbiased with respect to feature–feature dependencies, we also developed an extension to PCA that generates orthonormal features by examining the dependency structure of a controlled, baseline, dataset. We verified our methods are able to accurately track non-stationarity and the underlying variation in ground-truth parameters using an extensive variety of simulated dynamical systems (correlations from 0.9 to 1.0).
                        We then investigated neural responses to visual stimuli by applying our method to the Allen Neuropixels dataset, a spatio-temporal set of electrophysiological recordings from the mouse brain [3]. As a visual stimulus changes over time, our method automatically reveals channels that transition between states with distinct patterns of activity. In a single subject, we are able to temporally resolve the dynamical regimes of regions such as the primary visual cortex and lateral posterior nucleus, which include slow, periodic theta oscillations and higher-frequency broadband fluctuations, without aggregating local readings over imposed anatomical divisions (as required by most conventional methods).
                        Our new method has further advantages over conventional approaches to dimensionality reduction: i) it does not require phase-synchronized time series; ii) it produces an informative low-dimensional representation of complex dynamics, resolved over space and time; and iii) it can be directly interpreted in terms of the dynamical properties encapsulated by each feature, without the need to identify a model for the underlying system. Our approach can be applied to many forms of spatio-temporal neural data to understand how the dynamics of neural components respond to changes in the environment.

That is, our multitude of correlates of P-Consciousness are actually descriptions of specific {EM} field behaviors that are posed (hypothesized) as “the right” correlate by a particular theory of consciousness. Because of this, our 30 years of empirical progress can be reinterpreted as, in effect, the delivery of a large body of evidence that the standard model’s {EM} quadrant can deliver a 1PP. That is, all theories of consciousness are, in the end, merely recipes that select a particular subset of the totality of {EM} field expression that is brain tissue. With a universal convergence on {EM}, the science of P-Consciousness becomes a collaborative effort between neuroscience and physics. The collaboration acts in pursuit of a unified explanation applicable to all theories of consciousness while remaining mindful that the process still contains no real explanation as to why or how {EM} fields deliver a 1PP. The apparent continued lack of explanation is, however, different: this time, the way forward is opened through its direct connection to fundamental physics. This is the first result (Part I). Part {II} posits, in general terms, a structural (epistemic) add-on/upgrade to the standard model that has the potential to deliver the missing route to an explanation of how subjectivity is delivered through {EM} fields. The revised standard model, under the neuroscience/physics collaboration, intimately integrates with the existing “correlates of-” paradigm, which acts as its source of empirical evidence. No existing theory of consciousness is lost or invalidated.},

    abstract         = {In recent decades, the scientific study of consciousness has significantly increased our understanding of this elusive phenomenon. Yet, despite critical development in our understanding of the functional side of consciousness, we still lack a fundamental theory regarding its phenomenal aspect. There is an “explanatory gap” between our scientific knowledge of functional consciousness and its “subjective,” phenomenal aspects, referred to as the “hard problem” of consciousness. The phenomenal aspect of consciousness is the first-person answer to “what it’s like” question, and it has thus far proved recalcitrant to direct scientific investigation. Naturalistic dualists argue that it is composed of a primitive, private, non-reductive element of reality that is independent from the functional and physical aspects of consciousness. Illusionists, on the other hand, argue that it is merely a cognitive illusion, and that all that exists are ultimately physical, non-phenomenal properties. We contend that both the dualist and illusionist positions are flawed because they tacitly assume consciousness to be an absolute property that doesn’t depend on the observer. We develop a conceptual and a mathematical argument for a relativistic theory of consciousness in which a system either has or doesn’t have phenomenal consciousness with respect to some observer. Phenomenal consciousness is neither private nor delusional, just relativistic. In the frame of reference of the cognitive system, it will be observable (first-person perspective) and in other frame of reference it will not (third-person perspective). These two cognitive frames of reference are both correct, just as in the case of an observer that claims to be at rest while another will claim that the observer has constant velocity. Given that consciousness is a relativistic phenomenon, neither observer position can be privileged, as they both describe the same underlying reality. Based on relativistic phenomena in physics we developed a mathematical formalization for consciousness which bridges the explanatory gap and dissolves the hard problem. Given that the first-person cognitive frame of reference also offers legitimate observations on consciousness, we conclude by arguing that philosophers can usefully contribute to the science of consciousness by collaborating with neuroscientists to explore the neural basis of phenomenal structures.},

As a consequence, radically different processes may represent plausible driving mechanisms for information propagation. Here, we analyze almost one billion time-stamped events collected from several online platforms – including Telegram, Twitter and Weibo – over observation windows longer than ten years, and show that the propagation of information in social media is a universal and critical process. Universality arises from the observation of identical macroscopic patterns across platforms, irrespective of the details of the specific system at hand. Critical behavior is deduced from the power-law distributions, and corresponding hyperscaling relations, characterizing size and duration of avalanches of information. Statistical testing on our data indicates that a mixture of simple and complex contagion characterizes the propagation of information in social media. Data suggest that the complexity of the process is correlated with the semantic content of the information that is propagated.},

We investigated this contribution in multi-electrode array recordings from human and monkey neocortex by examining the spike-triggered {LFP} average (st-{LFP}). The resulting st-{LFPs} were dominated by broad spatio-temporal components due to ongoing activity, synaptic inputs and recurrent connectivity. To reduce the spatial reach of the st-{LFP} and observe the local field related to a single spike we applied a spatial filter, whose weights were adapted to the covariance of ongoing {LFP}. The filtered st-{LFPs} were limited to the perimeter of 800 μm around the neuron, and propagated at axonal speed, which is consistent with their unitary nature. In addition, we discriminated between putative inhibitory and excitatory neurons and found that the inhibitory st-{LFP} peaked at shorter latencies, consistently with previous findings in hippocampal slices. Thus, in human and monkey neocortex, the {LFP} reflects primarily inhibitory neuron activity.},

    abstract         = {Extracellular recordings are typically analysed by separating them into two distinct signals: local field potentials ({LFPs}) and spikes. Previous studies have shown that spikes, in the form of single-unit activity ({SUA}) or multiunit activity ({MUA}), can be inferred solely from {LFPs} with moderately good accuracy. {SUA} and {MUA} are typically extracted via threshold-based technique which may not be reliable when the recordings exhibit a low signal-to-noise ratio ({SNR}). Another type of spiking activity, referred to as entire spiking activity ({ESA}), can be extracted by a threshold-less, fast, and automated technique and has led to better performance in several tasks. However, its relationship with the {LFPs} has not been investigated. In this study, we aim to address this issue by inferring {ESA} from {LFPs} intracortically recorded from the motor cortex area of three monkeys performing different tasks. Results from long-term recording sessions and across subjects revealed that {ESA} can be inferred from {LFPs} with good accuracy. On average, the inference performance of {ESA} was consistently and significantly higher than those of {SUA} and {MUA}. In addition, local motor potential ({LMP}) was found to be the most predictive feature. The overall results indicate that {LFPs} contain substantial information about spiking activity, particularly {ESA}. This could be useful for understanding {LFP}-spike relationship and for the development of {LFP}-based {BMIs}.},

The method is parameter free, time scale independent and easy to visualize as illustrated by an application to real neuronal spike trains obtained in vitro from rat slices. In a comparison with existing approaches on spike trains extracted from a simulated Hindemarsh–Rose network, the {ISI}-distance performs as well as the best time-scale-optimized measure based on spike timing.},

  abstract         = {Key points We measured fractal (self-similar) fluctuations in ongoing spiking activity in subcortical (lateral geniculate nucleus, {LGN}) and cortical (area {MT}) visual areas in anaesthetised marmosets. Cells in the evolutionary ancient koniocellular {LGN} pathway and in area {MT} show high-amplitude fractal fluctuations, whereas evolutionarily newer parvocellular and magnocellular {LGN} cells do not. Spiking activity in koniocellular cells and {MT} cells shows substantial correlation to the local population activity, whereas activity in parvocellular and magnocellular cells is less correlated with local activity. We develop a model consisting of a fractal process and a global rate modulation which can reproduce and explain the fundamental relationship between fractal fluctuations and population coupling in {LGN} and {MT}. The model provides a unified account of apparently disparate aspects of neural spiking activity and can improve our understanding of information processing in evolutionary ancient and modern visual pathways. Abstract The brain represents and processes information through patterns of spiking activity, which is influenced by local and widescale brain circuits as well as intrinsic neural dynamics. Whether these influences have independent or linked effects on spiking activity is, however, not known. Here we measured spiking activity in two visual centres, the lateral geniculate nucleus ({LGN}) and cortical area {MT}, in marmoset monkeys. By combining the Fano-factor time curve, power spectral analysis and rescaled range analysis, we reveal inherent fractal fluctuations of spiking activity in {LGN} and {MT}. We found that the evolutionary ancient koniocellular (K) pathway in {LGN} and area {MT} exhibits strong fractal fluctuations at short ({\textless}1 s) time scales. Parvocellular (P) and magnocellular (M) {LGN} cells show weaker fractal fluctuations at longer (multi-second) time scales. In both {LGN} and {MT}, the amplitude and time scale of fractal fluctuations can explain short and long time scale spiking dynamics. We further show differential neuronal coupling of {LGN} and {MT} cells to local population spiking activity. The population coupling is intrinsically linked to fractal fluctuations: neurons showing stronger fluctuations are more strongly correlated to the local population activity. To understand this relationship, we modelled spiking activity using a fractal inhomogeneous Poisson process with dynamic rate, which is the product of an intrinsic stochastic fractal rate and a global modulatory gain. Our model explains the intrinsic links between neuronal spike rate and population coupling in {LGN} and {MT}, and establishes a unified account of dynamic spiking properties in afferent visual pathways.},

These measures are based on both interevent intervals and event counts and include the interevent-interval histogram, rescaled range analysis, the event-number histogram, the Fano factor, the Allan factor, and the periodogram. In addition, we applied these measures to surrogate versions of the data, generated by random shuffling of the order of interevent intervals. The counting statistics reveal 1/f-type fluctuations in the data (long-duration power-law correlation), which are not present in the shuffled data. Estimates of the fractal exponents measured for RGC- and their target LGN-spike trains are similar in value, indicating that the fractal behavior either is transmitted from one cell to the other or has a common origin. The gamma-r renewal process model, often used in the analysis of visual-neuron interevent intervals, describes certain short-term features of the RGC and LGN data reasonably well but fails to account for the long-duration correlation. We present a new model for visual-system nerve-spike firings: a gamma-r renewal process whose mean is modulated by fractal binomial noise. This fractal, doubly stochastic point process characterizes the statistical behavior of both RGC and LGN data sets remarkably well.},

    abstract         = {During visual stimulation, neurons in visual cortex often exhibit rhythmic and synchronous firing in the gamma-frequency (30–90 Hz) band. Whether this phenomenon plays a functional role during visual processing is not fully clear and remains heavily debated. In this article, we explore the function of gamma-synchronization in the context of predictive and efficient coding theories. These theories hold that sensory neurons utilize the statistical regularities in the natural world in order to improve the efficiency of the neural code, and to optimize the inference of the stimulus causes of the sensory data. In visual cortex, this relies on the integration of classical receptive field ({CRF}) data with predictions from the surround. Here we outline two main hypotheses about gamma-synchronization in visual cortex. First, we hypothesize that the precision of gamma-synchronization reflects the extent to which {CRF} data can be accurately predicted by the surround. Second, we hypothesize that different cortical columns synchronize to the extent that they accurately predict each other’s {CRF} visual input. We argue that these two hypotheses can account for a large number of empirical observations made on the stimulus dependencies of gamma-synchronization. Furthermore, we show that they are consistent with the known laminar dependencies of gamma-synchronization and the spatial profile of intercolumnar gamma-synchronization, as well as the dependence of gamma-synchronization on experience and development. Based on our two main hypotheses, we outline two additional hypotheses. First, we hypothesize that the precision of gamma-synchronization shows, in general, a negative dependence on {RF} size. In support, we review evidence showing that gamma-synchronization decreases in strength along the visual hierarchy, and tends to be more prominent in species with small V1 {RFs}. Second, we hypothesize that gamma-synchronized network dynamics facilitate the emergence of spiking output that is particularly information-rich and sparse.},

    abstract         = {Summary Working memory is thought to result from sustained neuron spiking. However, computational models suggest complex dynamics with discrete oscillatory bursts. We analyzed local field potential (LFP) and spiking from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of monkeys performing a working memory task. There were brief bursts of narrow-band gamma oscillations (45-100 Hz), varied in time and frequency, accompanying encoding and re-activation of sensory information. They appeared at a minority of recording sites associated with spiking reflecting the to-be-remembered items. Beta oscillations (20-35 Hz) also occurred in brief, variable bursts but reflected a default state interrupted by encoding and decoding. Only activity of neurons reflecting encoding/decoding correlated with changes in gamma burst rate. Thus, gamma bursts could gate access to, and prevent sensory interference with, working memory. This supports the hypothesis that working memory is manifested by discrete oscillatory dynamics and spiking, not sustained activity.},

    abstract         = {Rhythmic oscillations of neural activity permeate sensory systems. Studies in the visual system propose that broadband gamma oscillations (30 – 80 Hz) facilitate neuronal communication underlying visual perception. However, broadband gamma oscillations within and across visual areas show widely varying frequency and phase, providing constraints for synchronizing spike timing. Here, we analyzed data from the Allen Brain Observatory and performed new experiments that show narrowband gamma ({NBG}) oscillations (50 – 70 Hz) propagate and synchronize throughout the awake mouse thalamocortical visual system. Lateral geniculate ({LGN}) neurons fired with millisecond precision relative to {NBG} phase in primary visual cortex (V1) and multiple higher visual areas ({HVAs}). {NBG} in {HVAs} depended upon retinotopically aligned V1 activity, and neurons that fired at {NBG} frequencies showed enhanced functional connectivity within and across visual areas. Remarkably, {LGN} {ON} versus {OFF} neurons showed distinct and reliable spike timing relative to {NBG} oscillation phase across {LGN}, V1, and {HVAs}. Taken together, {NBG} oscillations may serve as a novel substrate for precise coordination of spike timing in functionally distinct subnetworks of neurons spanning multiple brain areas during awake vision.},

Here, we tracked the flow of spiking activity recorded from six interconnected levels of the mouse visual hierarchy. By analyzing leading and lagging spike-timing relationships among pairs of simultaneously recorded neurons, we created a cellular-scale directed network graph. Using a module-detection algorithm to cluster neurons based on shared connectivity patterns, we uncovered two multi-regional communication modules distributed across the hierarchy. The direction of signal flow both between and within these modules, differences in layer and area distributions, and distinct temporal dynamics suggest that one module transmits feedforward sensory signals, whereas the other integrates inputs for recurrent processing. These results suggest that multi-regional functional modules may be a fundamental feature of organization beyond cortical areas that supports signal propagation across hierarchical recurrent networks.},

Coherence of gamma oscillations (30–100 Hz) and spike-{LFP} coupling identified six physiological layers and further sublayers. Firing rates, burstiness, and other electrophysiological features of neurons displayed unique layer and brain state dependence. Spike transmission strength from layer 2/3 cells to layer 5 pyramidal cells and interneurons was stronger during waking compared with non-{REM} sleep but stronger during non-{REM} sleep among deep-layer excitatory neurons.

The temporal coordination of activity in a source population has been suggested to determine corticocortical signaling efficacy, but others have argued that coordination is functionally irrelevant. We reasoned that if coordination significantly influenced signaling, spiking in downstream networks should be preceded by transiently elevated coordination in a source population. We developed a metric to quantify network coordination in brief epochs, and applied it to simultaneous recordings of neuronal populations in cortical areas V1 and V2 of the macaque monkey. Spiking in the input layers of V2 was preceded by brief epochs of elevated V1 coordination, but this was not the case in other layers of V2. Our results indicate that V1 coordination influences its signaling to direct downstream targets, but that coordinated V1 epochs do not propagate through multiple downstream networks as in some corticocortical signaling schemes.},

Here we report that populations of neurons and {HGA} recorded from the orbitofrontal cortex ({OFC}) encode similar information, although there is little correspondence between signals recorded by the same electrode. {HGA} appears to aggregate heterogeneous neuron activity, such that the spiking of a single cell corresponds to only small increases in {HGA}. Interestingly, large-scale spatiotemporal dynamics are revealed in {HGA}, but less apparent in the population of single neurons. Overall, {HGA} is closely related to neuron activity in {OFC}, and provides a unique means of studying large-scale spatiotemporal dynamics of information processing.},

First, we use the copula-based dynamic conditional correlation ({DCC}), which does not rely on a specific distribution assumption, for estimating time-varying correlation between regions-of-interest ({ROIs}) of the human brain. Then, we suggest a time-varying partial correlation based on the Gaussian copula-{DCC}-{GARCH} model as an effective method for measuring {dFC} in the human brain. A recursive algorithm is explained for computation of the time-varying partial correlation. Numerical simulation results demonstrate effectiveness of the partial correlation-based methods against pairwise correlation-based methods. In addition, a two-step procedure is described for the inference of sparse {dFC} structure using functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) data. We illustrate the proposed method by analyzing an {fMRI} data set of human participants watching a Pixar animated movie. Based on twelve a priori selected brain regions in the cortex, we demonstrate that the proposed method is effective for inferring sparse {dFC} network structures and robust to noise distribution and a preprocessing step of {fMRI} data.},

In the hippocampal region {CA}1, a slow gamma rhythm (30-80 Hz) generated in {CA}3 would support memory retrieval whereas a medium gamma rhythm (60-120 Hz) generated in the entorhinal cortex would support memory encoding. However, descriptions involving discrete gamma sub-bands can only partially account for the haphazard diversity of oscillatory behaviors observed in individual recordings during spatial navigation behavior. Here, we stress that transient gamma oscillatory episodes at any frequency or phase relative to the ongoing theta (4-12 Hz) rhythm can be recorded at any layer within {CA}1. Eventually, the commonly reported averages are dominated by a minority of very strong power events overshadowing gamma heterogeneity. Nevertheless, we show that such gamma diversity can be naturally explained by a simple mechanistic model, and that behavior-related information (position within a maze) can be decoded from most individual gamma events, despite their low power and erratic-like nature. Our results indicate that behavior specifically shapes ensembles of irregular hippocampal gamma oscillations, in a way which evolves with learning, depends on the hippocampal layer and is hard to reconcile with the hypothesis of rigid, narrowly tuned gamma sub-bands. Beyond randomness, the pervasive gamma diversity may thus reflect complexity at the "fringe-of-synchrony" likely functional but invisible to classic average-based analyses.},

    abstract         = {Neural networks of the brain that process visual information have structural properties that differ significantly from those of neural networks which are commonly used for visual processing in {AI}, such as Convolutional Neural Networks ({CNNs}). But it has remained unknown how these structural differences are related to network function. We analyze visual processing capabilities of a large-scale model for area V1 that arguably provides the most comprehensive accumulation of anatomical and neurophysiological data that is currently available. Its network structure turns out to induce a number of characteristic visual processing capabilities of the brain, in particular the capability to multiplex different visual processing tasks, also on temporally dispersed visual information, with remarkable robustness to noise. This V1 model also exhibits a number of characteristic neural coding properties of the brain, which provide explanations for its superior noise robustness. Since visual processing in the brain is substantially more energy-efficient than implementations of {CNNs} in common computer hardware, such brain-like neural network models are likely to have also an impact on technology: As blueprints for visual processing in more energy-efficient neuromorphic hardware.

    abstract         = {Oscillatory activity is a widespread phenomenon in nervous systems and has been implicated in numerous functions. Signals that are generated by two separate neuronal sources often demonstrate a consistent phase-relationship in a particular frequency-band, i.e., they demonstrate rhythmic neuronal synchronization. This consistency is conventionally measured by the {PLV} (phase-locking value) or the spectral coherence measure. Both statistical measures suffer from significant bias, in that their sample estimates overestimate the population statistics for finite sample sizes. This is a significant problem in the neurosciences where statistical comparisons are often made between conditions with a different number of trials or between neurons with a different number of spikes. We introduce a new circular statistic, the {PPC} (pairwise phase consistency). We demonstrate that the sample estimate of the {PPC} is a bias-free and consistent estimator of its corresponding population parameter. We show, both analytically and by means of numerical simulations, that the population statistic of the {PPC} is equivalent to the population statistic of the squared {PLV}. The variance and mean squared error of the {PPC} and {PLV} are compared. Finally, we demonstrate the practical relevance of the method in actual neuronal data recorded from the orbitofrontal cortex of rats that engage in a two-odour discrimination task. We find a strong increase in rhythmic synchronization of spikes relative to the local field potential (as measured by the {PPC}) for a wide range of low frequencies (including the theta-band) during the anticipation of sucrose delivery in comparison to the anticipation of quinine delivery.},

The prevention of such catastrophic incidents poses huge challenges for reliability study and operational practices in power systems. Studies in other scientific fields show that, upon reaching a tipping point, complex dynamical systems can experience sudden transitions into a contrasting state. These transitions may be predicted through behavioral changes in some statistical measures of the system state. Inspired by these studies, this paper proposes an analysis of the critical transition in power systems from a long-term perspective. The evolution of the operational “stress” and its cyclical variation due to a slowly increasing demand and system expansions is simulated on a test system. The disturbances and the resulting failures under different stress levels are studied. Our analysis identifies the statistical trends known as flickering and critical slowing down in the operational and the recorded outage data along the simulation. These statistical changes can be used as early warning signals of the upcoming operational state which is more prone to a catastrophic blackout. The development of such early warning signals is the key to reaching higher levels of reliability in the energy supply infrastructure that society requires today.},

Periodic oscillations have been linked to numerous physiological, cognitive, behavioral and disease states. Emerging evidence demonstrates that the aperiodic component has putative physiological interpretations and that it dynamically changes with age, task demands and cognitive states. Electrophysiological neural activity is typically analyzed using canonically defined frequency bands, without consideration of the aperiodic (1/f-like) component. We show that standard analytic approaches can conflate periodic parameters (center frequency, power, bandwidth) with aperiodic ones (offset, exponent), compromising physiological interpretations. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an algorithm to parameterize neural power spectra as a combination of an aperiodic component and putative periodic oscillatory peaks. This algorithm requires no a priori specification of frequency bands. We validate this algorithm on simulated data, and demonstrate how it can be used in applications ranging from analyzing age-related changes in working memory to large-scale data exploration and analysis.},

    abstract         = {Neural oscillations often occur as transient bursts with variable amplitude and frequency dynamics. Quantifying these effects is important for understanding brain–behaviour relationships, especially in continuous datasets. To robustly measure bursts, rhythmical periods of oscillatory activity must be separated from arrhythmical background 1/f activity, which is ubiquitous in electrophysiological recordings. The Better {OSCillation} ({BOSC}) framework achieves this by defining a power threshold above the estimated background 1/f activity, combined with a duration threshold. Here we introduce a modification to this approach called {fBOSC}, which uses a spectral parametrisation tool to accurately model background 1/f activity in neural data. {fBOSC} (which is openly available as a {MATLAB} toolbox) is robust to power spectra with oscillatory peaks and can also model non-linear spectra. Through a series of simulations, we show that {fBOSC} more accurately models the 1/f power spectrum compared with existing methods. {fBOSC} was especially beneficial where power spectra contained a ‘knee’ below .5–10 Hz, which is typical in neural data. We also found that, unlike other methods, {fBOSC} was unaffected by oscillatory peaks in the neural power spectrum. Moreover, by robustly modelling background 1/f activity, the sensitivity for detecting oscillatory bursts was standardised across frequencies (e.g., theta- and alpha-bands). Finally, using openly available resting state magnetoencephalography and intracranial electrophysiology datasets, we demonstrate the application of {fBOSC} for oscillatory burst detection in the theta-band. These simulations and empirical analyses highlight the value of {fBOSC} in detecting oscillatory bursts, including in datasets that are long and continuous with no distinct experimental trials.},

This attention activity pattern with rich spatiotemporal dynamics flexibly samples from different stimulus locations, explaining many key aspects of temporal fluctuations such as variable theta oscillations of visual spatial attention. Moreover, the mechanism expands our understanding of how visual attention exploits spatially complex fluctuations characterized by superdiffusive motion in space and makes experimentally testable predictions. We further illustrate that attention sampling based on such spatiotemporal fluctuations provides profound functional advantages such as adaptive switching between exploitation and exploration activities and is particularly efficient at sampling natural scenes with multiple salient objects. A mechanism explains the spatiotemporal dynamics of visual attention and their functional role in sampling natural scenes.},

  abstract         = {A range of perceptual and cognitive processes have been characterized from the perspective of probabilistic representations and inference. To understand the neural circuit mechanism underlying these probabilistic computations, we develop a theory based on complex spatiotemporal dynamics of neural population activity. We first implement and explore this theory in a biophysically realistic, spiking neural circuit. Population activity patterns emerging from the circuit capture realistic variability or fluctuations of neural dynamics both in time and in space. These activity patterns implement a type of probabilistic computations that we name fractional neural sampling ({FNS}). We further develop a mathematical model to reveal the algorithmic nature of {FNS} and its computational advantages for representing multimodal distributions, a major challenge faced by existing theories. We demonstrate that {FNS} provides a unified account of a diversity of experimental observations of neural spatiotemporal dynamics and perceptual processes such as visual perception inference, and that {FNS} makes experimentally testable predictions.},

    abstract         = {The dynamics of many social, technological and economic phenomena are driven by individual human actions, turning the quantitative understanding of human behavior into a central question of modern science. Current models of human dynamics, used from risk assessment to communications, assume that human actions are randomly distributed in time and thus well approximated by Poisson processes. Here we provide direct evidence that for five human activity patterns, such as email and letter based communications, web browsing, library visits and stock trading, the timing of individual human actions follow non-Poisson statistics, characterized by bursts of rapidly occurring events separated by long periods of inactivity. We show that the bursty nature of human behavior is a consequence of a decision based queuing process: when individuals execute tasks based on some perceived priority, the timing of the tasks will be heavy tailed, most tasks being rapidly executed, while a few experiencing very long waiting times. In contrast, priority blind execution is well approximated by uniform interevent statistics. We discuss two queuing models that capture human activity. The first model assumes that there are no limitations on the number of tasks an individual can hadle at any time, predicting that the waiting time of the individual tasks follow a heavy tailed distribution P(τw)∼τ−αw with α=3∕2. The second model imposes limitations on the queue length, resulting in a heavy tailed waiting time distribution characterized by α=1. We provide empirical evidence supporting the relevance of these two models to human activity patterns, showing that while emails, web browsing and library visitation display α=1, the surface mail based communication belongs to the α=3∕2 universality class. Finally, we discuss possible extension of the proposed queuing models and outline some future challenges in exploring the statistical mechanics of human dynamics.},

    abstract         = {Social networks mediate the spread of information and disease. The dynamics of spreading depends, among other factors, on the distribution of times between successive contacts in the network. Heavy-tailed (bursty) time distributions are characteristic of human communication networks, including face-to-face contacts and electronic communication via mobile phone calls, email, and internet communities. Burstiness has been cited as a possible cause for slow spreading in these networks relative to a randomized reference network. However, it is not known whether burstiness is an epiphenomenon of human-specific patterns of communication. Moreover, theory predicts that fast, bursty communication networks should also exist. Here, we present a high-throughput technology for automated monitoring of social interactions of individual honeybees and the analysis of a rich and detailed dataset consisting of more than 1.2 million interactions in five honeybee colonies. We find that bees, like humans, also interact in bursts but that spreading is significantly faster than in a randomized reference network and remains so even after an experimental demographic perturbation. Thus, while burstiness may be an intrinsic property of social interactions, it does not always inhibit spreading in real-world communication networks. We anticipate that these results will inform future models of large-scale social organization and information and disease transmission, and may impact health management of threatened honeybee populations.},

These operations are implemented by a distributed, fronto-parietal cognitive control network in the brain. The neural mechanisms controlling interactions within this network are yet to be determined. Here, we show that during a working memory task the brain uses an oscillatory mechanism for regulating access to prefrontal cognitive resources, dynamically controlling interactions between prefrontal cortex and remote neocortical areas. Combining {EEG} with non-invasive brain stimulation we show that fast rhythmical brain activity at posterior sites are nested into prefrontal slow brain waves. Depending on cognitive demand this high frequency activity is nested into different phases of the slow wave enabling dynamic coupling or de-coupling of the fronto-parietal control network adjusted to cognitive effort. This mechanism constitutes a basic principle of coordinating higher cognitive functions in the human brain.},

    abstract         = {Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) has highlighted the rich structure of brain activity in absence of a task or stimulus. A great effort has been dedicated in the last two decades to investigate functional connectivity ({FC}), i.e. the functional interplay between different regions of the brain, which was for a long time assumed to have stationary nature. Only recently was the dynamic behaviour of {FC} revealed, showing that on top of correlational patterns of spontaneous {fMRI} signal fluctuations, connectivity between different brain regions exhibits meaningful variations within a typical resting-state {fMRI} experiment. As a consequence, a considerable amount of work has been directed to assessing and characterising dynamic {FC} ({dFC}), and several different approaches were explored to identify relevant {FC} fluctuations. At the same time, several questions were raised about the nature of {dFC}, which would be of interest only if brought back to a neural origin. In support of this, correlations with electroencephalography ({EEG}) recordings, demographic and behavioural data were established, and various clinical applications were explored, where the potential of {dFC} could be preliminarily demonstrated. In this review, we aim to provide a comprehensive description of the {dFC} approaches proposed so far, and point at the directions that we see as most promising for the future developments of the field. Advantages and pitfalls of {dFC} analyses are addressed, helping the readers to orient themselves through the complex web of available methodologies and tools.},

Top-down attention enhanced interareal local state coordination, traversing along the reverse cortical hierarchy.

To examine this issue, we tested rats in a hippocampus-dependent delayed spatial alternation task on a modified T maze while simultaneously recording local field potentials from dendritic and somatic layers of the dentate gyrus, {CA}3, and {CA}1 regions by using high-density, 96-site silicon probes. Both the power and coherence of gamma oscillations exhibited layer-specific changes during task performance. Peak increases in the gamma power and coherence were found in the {CA}3–{CA}1 interface on the maze segment approaching the T junction, independent of motor aspects of task performance. These results show that hippocampal networks can be dynamically coupled by gamma oscillations according to specific behavioral demands. Based on these findings, we propose that gamma oscillations may serve as a physiological mechanism by which {CA}3 output can coordinate {CA}1 activity to support retrieval of hippocampus-dependent memories.},

    abstract         = {Information processing in the nervous system critically relies on temporally precise spiking activity. In the auditory system, various degrees of phase-locking can be observed from the auditory nerve to cortical neurons. The classical metric for quantifying phase-locking is the vector strength ({VS}), which captures the periodicity in neuronal spiking. More recently, another metric, called the correlation index ({CI}), was proposed to quantify the temporally reproducible response characteristics of a neuron. The {CI} is defined as the peak value of a normalized shuffled autocorrelogram ({SAC}). Both {VS} and {CI} have been used to investigate how temporal information is processed and propagated along the auditory pathways. While previous analyses of physiological data in cats suggested covariation of these two metrics, general characterization of their connection has never been performed. In the present study, we derive a rigorous relationship between {VS} and {CI}. To model phase-locking, we assume Poissonian spike trains with a temporally changing intensity function following a von Mises distribution. We demonstrate that {VS} and {CI} are mutually related via the so-called concentration parameter that determines the degree of phase-locking. We confirm that these theoretical results are largely consistent with physiological data recorded in the auditory brainstem of various animals. In addition, we generate artificial phase-locked spike sequences, for which recording and analysis parameters can be systematically manipulated. Our analysis results suggest that mismatches between empirical data and the theoretical prediction can often be explained with deviations from the von Mises distribution, including skewed or multimodal period histograms. Furthermore, temporal relations of spike trains across trials can contribute to higher {CI} values than predicted mathematically based on the {VS}. We find that, for most applications, a {SAC} bin width of 50 ms seems to be a favorable choice, leading to an estimated error below 2.5\% for physiologically plausible conditions. Overall, our results provide general relations between the two measures of phase-locking and will aid future analyses of different physiological datasets that are characterized with these metrics.},

New approaches to NLPCA, principal manifolds, branching principal components and topology preserving mappings are described as well. Presentation of algorithms is supplemented by case studies, from engineering to astronomy, but mostly of biological data: analysis of microarray and metabolite data. The volume ends with a tutorial "PCA and K-means decipher genome". The book is meant to be useful for practitioners in applied data analysis in life sciences, engineering, physics and chemistry; it will also be valuable to PhD students and researchers in computer sciences, applied mathematics and statistics.},

While the electrophysiological correlates of brain states have been studied for some time, it remains unclear how large-scale cortico-cortical functional connectivity systematically reconfigures across states. Here, we investigate state-dependent shifts in cortical functional connectivity by recording local field potentials ({LFPs}) during spontaneous behavioral transitions in the ferret using chronically implanted micro-electrocorticographic (µ{ECoG}) arrays positioned over occipital, parietal, and temporal cortical regions. To objectively classify brain state, we describe a data-driven approach that projects time-varying {LFP} spectral properties into brain state space. Distinct brain states displayed markedly different patterns of cross-frequency phase-amplitude coupling and inter-electrode phase synchronization across several {LFP} frequency bands. The largest across-state differences in functional connectivity were observed between periods of presumed slow-wave and rapid-eye-movement-sleep/active-state, which were characterized by the contrasting phenomena of cortical network fragmentation and global synchronization, respectively. Collectively, our data provide strong evidence that large-scale functional interactions in the brain dynamically reconfigure across behavioral states.},

  abstract         = {Slow brain rhythms are attributed to near-simultaneous (synchronous) changes in activity in neuron populations in the brain. Because they are slow and widespread, synchronous rhythms have not been considered crucial for information processing in the waking state. Here we adapted methods from turbulence physics to analyze δ-band (1–4 Hz) rhythms in local field potential ({LFP}) activity, in multielectrode recordings from cerebral cortex in anesthetized marmoset monkeys. We found that synchrony contributes only a small fraction (less than one-fourth) to the local spatiotemporal structure of δ-band signals. Rather, δ-band activity is dominated by propagating plane waves and spatiotemporal structures, which we call complex waves. Complex waves are manifest at submillimeter spatial scales, and millisecond-range temporal scales. We show that complex waves can be characterized by their relation to phase singularities within local nerve cell networks. We validate the biological relevance of complex waves by showing that nerve cell spike rates are higher in presence of complex waves than in the presence of synchrony and that there are nonrandom patterns of evolution from one type of complex wave to another. We conclude that slow brain rhythms predominantly indicate spatiotemporally organized activity in local nerve cell circuits, not synchronous activity within and across brain regions.},

Beta power is predictive of healthy and abnormal behaviors, including perception, attention and motor action. In non-averaged signals, beta can emerge as transient high-power 'events'. As such, functionally relevant differences in averaged power across time and trials can reflect changes in event number, power, duration, and/or frequency span. We show that functionally relevant differences in averaged beta power in primary somatosensory neocortex reflect a difference in the number of high-power beta events per trial, i.e. event rate. Further, beta events occurring close to the stimulus were more likely to impair perception. These results are consistent across detection and attention tasks in human magnetoencephalography, and in local field potentials from mice performing a detection task. These results imply that an increased propensity of beta events predicts the failure to effectively transmit information through specific neocortical representations.},

It appears to be possible due to a natural mechanism of delayed relaxation of internal variables. Apart from that, there is another mechanism of creation of complexity, described with the help of the notion of information, which, alongside with the concept of entropy, is used during the description of complex systems. The fundamental foundation of possibility of transition to the higher forms of organization is a many-particle composition of the thermodynamic system, which is discussed in the second section of the chapter. Eventually, we shall be able to describe the practical methods of the creation of artificial complexity.},

These theorems were of great significance both in mathematics and in statistical mechanics. In statistical mechanics they provided a key insight into a 60-y-old fundamental problem of the subject{\textemdash}namely, the rationale for the hypothesis that time averages can be set equal to phase averages. The evolution of this problem is traced from the origins of statistical mechanics and Boltzman{\textquoteright}s ergodic hypothesis to the Ehrenfests{\textquoteright} quasi-ergodic hypothesis, and then to the ergodic theorems. We discuss communications between von Neumann and Birkhoff in the Fall of 1931 leading up to the publication of these papers and related issues of priority. These ergodic theorems initiated a new field of mathematical-research called ergodic theory that has thrived ever since, and we discuss some of recent developments in ergodic theory that are relevant for statistical mechanics.},

    abstract         = {Familiarity of the environment changes the way we perceive and encode incoming information. However, the neural substrates underlying this phenomenon are poorly understood. Here we describe a new form of experience-dependent low-frequency oscillations in the primary visual cortex (V1) of awake adult male mice. The oscillations emerged in visually evoked potentials and single-unit activity following repeated visual stimulation. The oscillations were sensitive to the spatial frequency content of a visual stimulus and required the mAChRs for their induction and expression. Finally, ongoing visually evoked θ (4{\textendash}8 Hz) oscillations boost the visually evoked potential amplitude of incoming visual stimuli if the stimuli are presented at the high excitability phase of the oscillations. Our results demonstrate that an oscillatory code can be used to encode familiarity and serves as a gate for oncoming sensory inputs.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Previous experience can influence the processing of incoming sensory information by the brain and alter perception. However, the mechanistic understanding of how this process takes place is lacking. We have discovered that persistent low-frequency oscillations in the primary visual cortex encode information about familiarity and the spatial frequency of the stimulus. These familiarity evoked oscillations influence neuronal responses to the oncoming stimuli in a way that depends on the oscillation phase. Our work demonstrates a new mechanism of visual stimulus feature detection and learning.},

Peng et al. found that the orientational ordering of a liquid crystal could direct the flow of self-propelling bacteria, which in turn influenced the patterning of the liquid crystal molecules. Patterns on a substrate caused surface anchoring of the liquid crystals that transmitted to the ordering of the bacteria, thus imparting control on what would otherwise be chaotic out-of-equilibrium behavior. Science, this issue p. 882 Surface patterns orient liquid crystal molecules that control concentration, trajectories, and flows of swimming bacteria. Self-propelled bacteria are marvels of nature with a potential to power dynamic materials and microsystems of the future. The challenge lies in commanding their chaotic behavior. By dispersing swimming Bacillus subtilis in a liquid crystalline environment with spatially varying orientation of the anisotropy axis, we demonstrate control over the distribution of bacterial concentration, as well as the geometry and polarity of their trajectories. Bacteria recognize subtle differences in liquid crystal deformations, engaging in bipolar swimming in regions of pure splay and bend but switching to unipolar swimming in mixed splay-bend regions. They differentiate topological defects, heading toward defects of positive topological charge and avoiding negative charges. Sensitivity of bacteria to preimposed orientational patterns represents a previously unknown facet of the interplay between hydrodynamics and topology of active matter.},

However, no direct link has been established between traveling waves and neuronal spiking in humans. We examined traveling waves in the human lateral temporal lobe by using recordings from intracranial electrodes implanted in twenty participants for seizure monitoring as they performed a paired-associates verbal memory task. We observed ubiquitous low frequency traveling waves across the temporal lobe. While wave occurrence in a broad low frequency range did not differ between successful and unsuccessful memory conditions, in a subset of participants with microelectrode recordings, we found that macro-scale waves co-occurred with micro-scale waves, which in turn were temporally locked to single unit spiking. This temporal coordination between traveling waves at different spatial scales and between waves and neuronal spiking in the human brain suggests a role for traveling waves in neural communication.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

This view was challenged by evidence of contextual interactions between stimulus dimensions in which a neuron’s response to one dimension strongly depends on other dimensions. Here, we use methods of mathematical modeling, psychophysics, and electrophysiology to address shortcomings of the traditional view. Using a model of a generic cortical circuit, we begin with the simple demonstration that cortical responses are always distributed among neurons, forming characteristic waveforms, which we call neural waves. When stimulated by patterned stimuli, circuit responses arise by interference of neural waves. Results of this process depend on interaction between stimulus dimensions. Comparison of modeled responses with responses of biological vision makes it clear that the framework of neural wave interference provides a useful alternative to the standard concept of neural computation. Investigating interference of neural waves helps to overcome limitations of the traditional view of cortical computation.},

    abstract         = {High-throughput experimental methods in neuroscience have led to an explosion of techniques for measuring complex interactions and multi-dimensional patterns. However, whether sophisticated measures of emergent phenomena can be traced back to simpler low-dimensional statistics is largely unknown. To explore this question, we examine resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data using complex topology measures from network neuroscience. We show that spatial and temporal autocorrelation are reliable statistics which explain numerous measures of network topology. Surrogate timeseries with subject-matched spatial and temporal autocorrelation capture nearly all reliable individual and regional variation in these topology measures. Network topology changes during aging are driven by spatial autocorrelation, and multiple serotonergic drugs causally induce the same topographic change in temporal autocorrelation. This reductionistic interpretation of widely-used complexity measures may help link them to neurobiology.Competing Interest StatementKHP is currently an employee of Hoffmann-La Roche.

    abstract         = {Gamma-frequency oscillations have been hypothesized as a physiological mechanism of interregional communication in the brain. However, until now, all supporting data have been correlational and thus indirect. Fernández-Ruiz et al. examined gamma-frequency activity and spike coupling between the entorhinal cortex and hippocampal dentate gyrus during learning and after selective perturbation of gamma-frequency spike timing. They observed an integrated neuron, gamma-band, and task-specific organization of the entorhinal cortex–hippocampal circuits. These data demonstrate that specific, projected gamma-frequency oscillation patterns dynamically engage functionally related cell assemblies across brain regions in a task-specific manner. Science, this issue p. eabf3119 Frequency- and task-specific gamma rhythms synchronize populations of neurons during learning in rats. Gamma oscillations are thought to coordinate the spike timing of functionally specialized neuronal ensembles across brain regions. To test this hypothesis, we optogenetically perturbed gamma spike timing in the rat medial (MEC) and lateral (LEC) entorhinal cortices and found impairments in spatial and object learning tasks, respectively. MEC and LEC were synchronized with the hippocampal dentate gyrus through high- and low-gamma-frequency rhythms, respectively, and engaged either granule cells or mossy cells and CA3 pyramidal cells in a task-dependent manner. Gamma perturbation disrupted the learning-induced assembly organization of target neurons. Our findings imply that pathway-specific gamma oscillations route task-relevant information between distinct neuronal subpopulations in the entorhinal-hippocampal circuit. We hypothesize that interregional gamma-time-scale spike coordination is a mechanism of neuronal communication.},

In the standard model of cosmology the Universe begins in a very hot state, right after at the end of inflation via the process of reheating/preheating, and cools to its present temperature as the Universe expands. Both new and existing physics at any scale can be responsible for catalyzing either first, second or cross over phase transition, which could be either thermal or non-thermal with a potential observable imprints. Thus this field prompts a rich dialogue between gravity, particle physics and cosmology. It is all but certain that at least two cosmic phase transitions have occurred—the electroweak and the QCD phase transitions. The focus of this review will be primarily on phase transitions above such scales, We review different types of phase transitions that can appear in our cosmic history, and their applications and experimental signatures in particular in the context of exciting gravitational waves, which could be potentially be constrained by LIGO/VIRGO, Kagra, LISA, and Decigo.},

If the effective potential satisfies certain general conditions, a homogeneous phase of false vacuum will form as the Universe expands, and the transition will proceed by well-known bubble nucleation processes. If such conditions do not hold, the Universe may instead be filled with a two-phase emulsion. The evolution of the transition will be determined by the free energy difference between the two phases and by the expansion rate of the Universe. Thermal fluctuations between the phases will determine the final distribution of regions of the Universe in each phase as they freeze out. We develop a method to study the dynamics of such fluctuations, which we call sub-critical bubbles, and apply it to several situations of interest, including the symmetric and asymmetric double-well, and the Coleman-Weinberg scalar potentials. We show that in certain cases it is possible to avoid supercooling, with the transition being completed by sub-critical fluctuations. Possible applications to the electroweak phase transition are briefly discussed.},

This active hair-bundle motility constitutes the active process of some non-mammalian tetrapods.An outer hair cell of the mammalian cochlea displays somatic motility, in which changes in the transmembrane voltage alter the membrane area occupied by the piezoelectric protein prestin. Depolarization causes the cell body to contract and hyperpolarization causes it to extend at frequencies that can exceed 100 kHz.Acoustic stimulation evokes on the elastic basilar membrane a travelling wave that progresses from the cochlear base towards the apex, peaking at a specific position determined by the stimulus frequency. As this wave advances, the active process of successive hair cells adds energy to counter viscous dissipation.The active process of the mammalian cochlea combines active hair-bundle motility and somatic motility; the former mechanism probably regulates the phase of responsiveness, whereas the latter provides most of the mechanical power.The characteristics of the active process reflect the operation of hair cells near a dynamical instability, the Hopf bifurcation, the generic properties of which explain various phenomena associated with hearing. When extreme quiet excites the active process sufficiently, hair cells traverse the bifurcation and -- even in most individuals with normal hearing -- produce spontaneous oscillations that emerge from the ears.},

    abstract         = {The Wilson-Cowan neural field equations describe the dynamical behavior of a 1-D continuum of excitatory and inhibitory cortical neural aggregates, using a pair of coupled integro-differential equations. Here we use bifurcation theory and small-noise linear stochastics to study the range of a phase transitions--sudden qualitative changes in the state of a dynamical system emerging from a bifurcation--accessible to the Wilson-Cowan network. Specifically, we examine saddle-node, Hopf, Turing, and Turing-Hopf instabilities. We introduce stochasticity by adding small-amplitude spatio-temporal white noise, and analyze the resulting subthreshold fluctuations using an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck linearization. This analysis predicts divergent changes in correlation and spectral characteristics of neural activity during close approach to bifurcation from below. We validate these theoretical predictions using numerical simulations. The results demonstrate the role of noise in the emergence of critically slowed precursors in both space and time, and suggest that these early-warning signals are a universal feature of a neural system close to bifurcation. In particular, these precursor signals are likely to have neurobiological significance as early warnings of impending state change in the cortex. We support this claim with an analysis of the in vitro local field potentials recorded from slices of mouse-brain tissue. We show that in the period leading up to emergence of spontaneous seizure-like events, the mouse field potentials show a characteristic spectral focusing toward lower frequencies concomitant with a growth in fluctuation variance, consistent with critical slowing near a bifurcation point. This observation of biological criticality has clear implications regarding the feasibility of seizure prediction.},

    abstract         = {Various complex systems, such as the climate, ecosystems, and physical and mental health can show large shifts in response to small changes in their environment. These ‘tipping points’ are notoriously hard to predict based on trends. However, in the past 20 years several indicators pointing to a loss of resilience have been developed. These indicators use fluctuations in time series to detect critical slowing down preceding a tipping point. Most of the existing indicators are based on models of one-dimensional systems. However, complex systems generally consist of multiple interacting entities. Moreover, because of technological developments and wearables, multivariate time series are becoming increasingly available in different fields of science. In order to apply the framework of resilience indicators to multivariate time series, various extensions have been proposed. Not all multivariate indicators have been tested for the same types of systems and therefore a systematic comparison between the methods is lacking. Here, we evaluate the performance of the different multivariate indicators of resilience loss in different scenarios. We show that there is not one method outperforming the others. Instead, which method is best to use depends on the type of scenario the system is subject to. We propose a set of guidelines to help future users choose which multivariate indicator of resilience is best to use for their particular system.},

Various early warning signals (EWSs) have been developed to anticipate the coming critical transition or distinguish types of transition. However, no effective method allows to establish practical threshold indicating the condition when the critical transition is most likely to occur. Here, we introduce a powerful EWS, named dynamical eigenvalue (DEV), that is rooted in bifurcation theory of dynamical systems to estimate the dominant eigenvalue of the system. Theoretically, the absolute value of DEV approaches 1 when the system approaches bifurcation, while its position in the complex plane indicates the type of transition. We demonstrate the efficacy of the DEV approach in model systems with known bifurcation types and also test the DEV approach on various critical transitions in real-world systems. Critical transitions can be distinguished and anticipated using a Dynamic Eigen-Value approach.},

    abstract         = {Hair cells in the auditory, vestibular, and lateral-line systems of vertebrates receive inputs through a remarkable variety of accessory structures that impose complex mechanical loads on the mechanoreceptive hair bundles. Although the physiological and morphological properties of the hair bundles in each organ are specialized for detecting the relevant inputs, we propose that the mechanical load on the bundles also adjusts their responsiveness to external signals. We use a parsimonious description of active hair-bundle motility to show how the mechanical environment can regulate a bundle’s innate behavior and response to input. We find that an unloaded hair bundle can behave very differently from one subjected to a mechanical load. Depending on how it is loaded, a hair bundle can function as a switch, active oscillator, quiescent resonator, or low-pass filter. Moreover, a bundle displays a sharply tuned, nonlinear, and sensitive response for some loading conditions and an untuned or weakly tuned, linear, and insensitive response under other circumstances. Our simple characterization of active hair-bundle motility explains qualitatively most of the observed features of bundle motion from different organs and organisms. The predictions stemming from this description provide insight into the operation of hair bundles in a variety of contexts.},

Such changes, called regime shifts, can lead to degradation of ecological services. We study simple ecological models that show a catastrophic transition as a control parameter is varied and propose a novel early warning signal that exploits two ubiquitous features of ecological systems: nonlinearity and large external fluctuations. Either reduced resilience or increased external fluctuations can tip ecosystems to an alternative stable state. It is shown that changes in asymmetry in the distribution of time series data, quantified by changing skewness, is a model-independent and reliable early warning signal for both routes to regime shifts. Furthermore, using model simulations that mimic field measurements and a simple analysis of real data from abrupt climate change in the Sahara, we study the feasibility of skewness calculations using data available from routine monitoring.},

To date, the majority of studies on the predictability of critical transitions consider systems perturbed with temporally uncorrelated noise. In contrast, here we study catastrophic and non-catastrophic transitions, and the performance of associated EWSs in systems perturbed with correlated noise. We find that elevated noise correlation can advance the occurrence of a catastrophic transition, and simultaneously progresses the system’s recovery. However, noise correlation does not have a significant impact on the likelihood of non-catastrophic transitions. We show that depending upon the transition mechanism, the occurrence of weak to false signals increases with noise reddening. Imperfect data sampling, both spatial and temporal, further reduces the efficacy of EWSs. Spatially limited data has more impact on the efficacy of EWSs for negative noise correlation than that of positive. However, temporally imperfect data is more detrimental for positively correlated noise. Overall, our study suggests that performance of EWSs is critical to system-specific perturbations as well as data sampling.},

How can we construct intuitive descriptions of arbitrary non-stationarity in time-series data, then use this summary to infer changes in a system’s underlying parameters? In this talk I will present our new method for quantifying non-stationary variation in terms of low-dimensional time-series features, which allows us to understand how the dynamics of a complex system change over time and space. Our method accurately tracks a broad variety of non-stationarities in a range of simulated test systems, where non-stationarity was controlled by ground-truth parameter values. I will also show how we analyse high-dimensional, spatio-temporal Neuropixels recordings to automatically uncover regions of the brain that transition between distinct dynamical states as environmental parameters change over time. Our feature-based approach to dimensionality reduction provides a comprehensive but interpretable summary of non-stationarity that captures meaningful changes in the dynamical properties as well as the underlying parameters of time-varying systems.},

    abstract         = {The responses of pairs of neurons to repeated presentations of the same stimulus are typically correlated, and an identical neuronal population can perform many functions. This suggests that the relevant units of computation are not single neurons but subspaces of the complete population activity. To test this idea, Ni et al. measured the relationship between neuronal population activity and performance in monkeys. They investigated attention, which improves perception of attended stimuli, and perceptual learning, which improves perception of well-practiced stimuli. These two processes operate on different time scales and are usually studied using different perceptual tasks. Manipulation of attention and learning in the same behavioral trials and the same neuronal populations revealed the dimensions of population activity that matter most for behavior. Science, this issue p. 463 Attention and perceptual learning in monkeys are associated with a decrease in correlated neuronal population activity in a particular brain area. Prior studies have demonstrated that correlated variability changes with cognitive processes that improve perceptual performance. We tested whether correlated variability covaries with subjects’ performance—whether performance improves quickly with attention or slowly with perceptual learning. We found a single, consistent relationship between correlated variability and behavioral performance, regardless of the time frame of correlated variability change. This correlated variability was oriented along the dimensions in population space used by the animal on a trial-by-trial basis to make decisions. That subjects’ choices were predicted by specific dimensions that were aligned with the correlated variability axis clarifies long-standing paradoxes about the relationship between shared variability and behavior.},

Prov-ably accurate solutions for PCA have been in use for a long time. However, to the best of our knowledge, all existing theoretical guarantees for it assume that the data and the corrupting noise are mutually independent, or at least uncorrelated. This is valid in practice often, but not always. In this paper, we study the PCA problem in the setting where the data and noise can be correlated. Such noise is often also referred to as "data-dependent noise". We obtain a correctness result for the standard eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) based solution to PCA under simple assumptions on the data-noise correlation. We also develop and analyze a generalization of EVD, cluster-EVD, that improves upon EVD in certain regimes.},

    abstract         = {Normalization is a mandatory preprocessing step in time series problems to guarantee similarity comparisons invariant to unexpected distortions in amplitude and offset. Such distortions are usual for most time series data. A typical example is gait recognition by motion collected on subjects with varying body height and width. To rescale the data for the same range of values, the vast majority of researchers consider z-normalization as the default method for any domain application, data, or task. This choice is made without a searching process as occurs to set the parameters of an algorithm or without any experimental evidence in the literature considering a variety of scenarios to support this decision. To address this gap, we evaluate the impact of different normalization methods on time series data. Our analysis is based on an extensive experimental comparison on classification problems involving 10 normalization methods, 3 state-of-the-art classifiers, and 38 benchmark datasets. We consider the classification task due to the simplicity of the experimental settings and well-defined metrics. However, our findings can be extrapolated for other time series mining tasks, such as forecasting or clustering. Based on our results, we suggest to evaluate the maximum absolute scale as an alternative to z-normalization. Besides being time efficient, this alternative shows promising results for similarity-based methods using Euclidean distance. For deep learning, mean normalization could be considered.},

We consider various ranges of the parameters representing the bandwidth of the noise, its spectral height, and the dissipation coefficient. We employ singular perturbation methods to derive explicit analytical approximations for the stationary density of fluctuations about the deterministically meta-stable state at the bottom of the well, and for the mean first passage time to overcome the potential barrier and escape the well. The latter leads to a formula for the escape (activation) rate. Among other results we find that the mean first passage time is exponentially larger than in the white noise case.},

    abstract         = {Recent experimental and theoretical studies have highlighted the importance of cell-to-cell differences in the dynamics and functions of neural networks, such as in different types of neural coding or synchronization. It is still not known, however, how neural heterogeneity can affect cortical computations, or impact the dynamics of typical cortical circuits constituted of sparse excitatory and inhibitory networks. In this work, we analytically and numerically study the dynamics of a typical cortical circuit with a certain level of neural heterogeneity. Our circuit includes realistic features found in real cortical populations, such as network sparseness, excitatory, and inhibitory subpopulations of neurons, and different cell-to-cell heterogeneities for each type of population in the system. We find highly differentiated roles for heterogeneity, depending on the subpopulation in which it is found. In particular, while heterogeneity among excitatory neurons non-linearly increases the mean firing rate and linearizes the f-I curves, heterogeneity among inhibitory neurons may decrease the network activity level and induces divisive gain effects in the f-I curves of the excitatory cells, providing an effective gain control mechanism to influence information flow. In addition, we compute the conditions for stability of the network activity, finding that the synchronization onset is robust to inhibitory heterogeneity, but it shifts to lower input levels for higher excitatory heterogeneity. Finally, we provide an extension of recently reported heterogeneity-induced mechanisms for signal detection under rate coding, and we explore the validity of our findings when multiple sources of heterogeneity are present. These results allow for a detailed characterization of the role of neural heterogeneity in asynchronous cortical networks.},

V1 responses encode positions that co-fluctuate with those encoded by place cells in hippocampal area CA1. This correlation might reflect a common influence of non-visual spatial signals on both areas. Place cells in CA1, indeed, do not rely only on vision; their place preference depends on the physical distance traveled and on the phase of the 6--9 Hz theta oscillation. Are V1 responses similarly influenced by these non-visual factors? We recorded V1 and CA1 neurons simultaneously while mice performed a spatial task in a virtual corridor by running on a wheel and licking at a reward location. By changing the gain that couples the wheel movement to the virtual environment, we found that ∼20\% of V1 neurons were influenced by the physical distance traveled, as were ∼40\% of CA1 place cells. Moreover, the firing rate of ∼24\% of V1 neurons was modulated by the phase of theta oscillations recorded in CA1 and the response profiles of ∼7\% of V1 neurons shifted spatially across the theta cycle, analogous to the phase precession observed in ∼37\% of CA1 place cells. The influence of theta oscillations on V1 responses was more prominent in putative layer 6. These results reveal that, in a familiar environment, sensory processing in V1 is modulated by the key non-visual signals that influence spatial coding in the hippocampus.},

Thus, experience-induced changes in V1 are often interpreted as improving visual perception (i.e., perceptual learning). Here we describe how, with experience, cue-evoked oscillations emerge in V1 to convey expected reward time as well as to relate experienced reward rate. We show, in chronic multisite local field potential recordings from rat V1, that repeated presentation of visual cues induces the emergence of visually evoked oscillatory activity. Early in training, the visually evoked oscillations relate to the physical parameters of the stimuli. However, with training, the oscillations evolve to relate the time in which those stimuli foretell expected reward. Moreover, the oscillation prevalence reflects the reward rate recently experienced by the animal. Thus, training induces experience-dependent changes in V1 activity that relate to what those stimuli have come to signify behaviorally: when to expect future reward and at what rate.},

  abstract         = {Perceptual and cognitive processing relies on flexible communication among cortical areas; however, the underlying neural mechanism remains unclear. Here we report a mechanism based on the realistic spatiotemporal dynamics of propagating wave patterns in neural population activity. Using a biophysically plausible, multiarea spiking neural circuit model, we demonstrate that these wave patterns, characterized by their rich and complex dynamics, can account for a wide variety of empirically observed neural processes. The coordinated interactions of these wave patterns give rise to distributed and dynamic communication (DDC) that enables flexible and rapid routing of neural activity across cortical areas. We elucidate how DDC unifies the previously proposed oscillation synchronization-based and subspace-based views of interareal communication, offering experimentally testable predictions that we validate through the analysis of Allen Institute Neuropixels data. Furthermore, we demonstrate that DDC can be effectively modulated during attention tasks through the interplay of neuromodulators and cortical feedback loops. This modulation process explains many neural effects of attention, underscoring the fundamental functional role of DDC in cognition.},

                        Scale-free dynamics, with a power spectrum following P ∝ f −β, are an intrinsic feature of many complex processes in nature. In neural systems, scale-free activity is often neglected in electrophysiological research. Here, we investigate scale-free dynamics in human brain and show that it contains extensive nested frequencies, with the phase of lower frequencies modulating the amplitude of higher frequencies in an upward progression across the frequency spectrum. The functional significance of scale-free brain activity is indicated by task performance modulation and regional variation, with β being larger in default network and visual cortex and smaller in hippocampus and cerebellum. The precise patterns of nested frequencies in the brain differ from other scale-free dynamics in nature, such as earth seismic waves and stock market fluctuations, suggesting system-specific generative mechanisms. Our findings reveal robust temporal structures and behavioral significance of scale-free brain activity and should motivate future study on its physiological mechanisms and cognitive implications.},

We focus our discussion of analyses around the broad themes of activation, correlation, communication and coding. We provide recommendations for interpreting the data using forward and inverse models. The forward model describes how field potentials are generated by the activity of populations of neurons. The inverse model describes how to infer the activity of populations of neurons from field potential recordings. A recurring theme is the challenge of understanding how field potentials reflect neuronal population activity given the complexity of the underlying brain systems.},

One of the most plausible candidate mechanisms behind large-scale integration is the formation of dynamic links among brain regions, links that are mediated by phase synchronization. Phase synchronization refers to the relation between the temporal structures of the neural signals regardless of signal amplitude. Two signals are said to be synchronous if their rhythms coincide. Neural assemblies -- distributed networks of neurons linked by reciprocal connections -- provide a conceptual framework for the integration of distributed neural activity. Large-scale integration commonly involves neural assemblies separated by long distances. Converging evidence indicates that phase synchrony is probably involved in brain integration. Electrophysiological analyses in cats and primates have shown that the emergence of phase synchrony over widespread cortical domain correlates with the occurrence of attentive and perceptuomotor behaviours, as well as during the execution of a learning task. Analogous findings have been made in humans using electroencephalographic and magnetoencephalographic techniques. Although the evidence for phase synchronization as a mechanism for large-scale integration is well grounded, it is only correlative. Direct proof that changes in synchronous activity can affect behaviour remains to be established in most cases. Similarly, the cellular mechanisms of synchronization, the interplay between slow and fast brain rhythms, and the role of parallel phase synchronization over different frequency bands constitute topics for future research.},

The properties of these brain spirals, such as their rotational directions and locations, are task relevant and can be used to classify different cognitive tasks. We also demonstrate that multiple, interacting brain spirals are involved in coordinating the correlated activations and de-activations of distributed functional regions; this mechanism enables flexible reconfiguration of task-driven activity flow between bottom-up and top-down directions during cognitive processing. Our findings suggest that brain spirals organize complex spatiotemporal dynamics of the human brain and have functional correlates to cognitive processing.},

    abstract         = {Hierarchy is a major organizational principle of the cortex and underscores modern computational theories of cortical function. The local microcircuit amplifies long-distance inter-areal input, which show distance-dependent changes in their laminar profiles. Statistical modeling of these changes in laminar profiles demonstrates that inputs from multiple hierarchical levels to their target areas show remarkable consistency, allowing the construction of a cortical hierarchy based on a principle of hierarchical distance. The statistical modeling that is applied to structure can also be applied to laminar differences in the oscillatory coherence between areas thereby determining a functional hierarchy of the cortex. Close examination of the anatomy of inter-areal connectivity reveals a dual counterstream architecture with well-defined distance-dependent feedback and feedforward pathways in both the supra- and infragranular layers, suggesting a multiplicity of feedback pathways with well-defined functional properties. These findings are consistent with feedback connections providing a generative network involved in a wide range of cognitive functions. A dynamical model constrained by connectivity data sheds insight into the experimentally observed signatures of frequency-dependent Granger causality for feedforward versus feedback signaling. Concerted experiments capitalizing on recent technical advances and combining tract-tracing, high-resolution fMRI, optogenetics and mathematical modeling hold the promise of a much improved understanding of lamina-constrained mechanisms of neural computation and cognition. However, because inter-areal interactions involve cortical layers that have been the target of important evolutionary changes in the primate lineage, these investigations will need to include human and non-human primate comparisons.},

However, no in vivo study to date has directly interrelated θ oscillations with the membrane potentials (Vm) of multiple neurons, and it remains unclear whether LFPs can be predicted from multineuronal Vms. Here, we simultaneously patch-clamp up to three CA1 pyramidal neurons in awake or anesthetized mice and find that the temporal evolution of the power and frequency of θ oscillations in Vms (θVms) are weakly but significantly correlate with LFP θ oscillations (θLFP) such that a deep neural network could predict the θLFP waveforms based on the θVm traces of three neurons. Therefore, individual neurons are loosely interdependent to ensure freedom of activity, but they partially share information to collectively produce θLFP.},

In mice, theta (5-10 Hz) stands as one of the most studied slow rhythms. However, mice often breathe at theta frequency, and we recently reported that nasal respiration leads to local field potential (LFP) oscillations that are independent of theta. Namely, we showed respiration-coupled oscillations in the hippocampus, prelimbic cortex, and parietal cortex, suggesting that respiration could impose a global brain rhythm. Here we extend these findings by analyzing LFPs from 15 brain regions recorded simultaneously with respiration during exploration and REM sleep. We find that respiration-coupled oscillations can be detected in parallel with theta in several neocortical regions, from prefrontal to visual areas, and also in subcortical structures such as the thalamus, amygdala and ventral hippocampus. They might have escaped attention in previous studies due to the absence of respiration monitoring, the similarity with theta oscillations, and the highly variable peak frequency. We hypothesize that respiration-coupled oscillations constitute a global brain rhythm suited to entrain distributed networks into a common regime. However, whether their widespread presence reflects local network activity or is due to volume conduction remains to be determined.},

Here, we show for a large group of healthy individuals and patients that the probability of an upcoming shift between a depressed and a normal state is related to elevated temporal autocorrelation, variance, and correlation between emotions in fluctuations of autorecorded emotions. These are indicators of the general phenomenon of critical slowing down, which is expected to occur when a system approaches a tipping point. Our results support the hypothesis that mood may have alternative stable states separated by tipping points, and suggest an approach for assessing the likelihood of transitions into and out of depression.},

We then demonstrate that this network, trained on simulated data, can reliably predict observed real-world transitions in systems ranging from rapid climatic change to the collapse of ecological populations. Importantly, our model appears to capture latent properties in time series missed by previous warning signals approaches, allowing us to not only detect if a transition is approaching, but critically whether the collapse will be catastrophic or non-catastrophic. These novel properties mean EWSNet has the potential to serve as an indicator of transitions across a broad spectrum of complex systems, without requiring information on the structure of the system being monitored. Our work highlights the practicality of deep learning for addressing further questions pertaining to ecosystem collapse and has much broader management implications.},

Firing of the pyramidal neurons, which carries the output to higher cortical areas, depends critically on the interaction of these pathways. Here we examined synaptic integration of inputs from layer 4 and layer 2/3 in rat visual cortical slices. We found that the integration is sublinear and temporally asymmetric, with larger responses if layer 2/3 input preceded layer 4 input. The sublinearity depended on inhibition, and the asymmetry was largely attributable to the difference between the two inhibitory inputs. Interestingly, the asymmetric integration was specific to pyramidal neurons, and it strongly affected their spiking output. Thus via cortical inhibition, the temporal order of activation of layer 2/3 and layer 4 pathways can exert powerful control of cortical output during visual processing.},

The pulvinar is ideally positioned to synchronize activity across the visual cortex. Saalmann et al. (p. 753) combined diffusion tensor imaging with multi-electrode recordings from three different brain areas in monkeys to probe thalamo-cortical interactions during visual attention. The pulvinar was found to play a vital role in attention by routing behaviorally relevant information across the visual cortex. A region of the thalamus synchronizes neuronal firing in two cortical areas and thus allocates attention. Selective attention mechanisms route behaviorally relevant information through large-scale cortical networks. Although evidence suggests that populations of cortical neurons synchronize their activity to preferentially transmit information about attentional priorities, it is unclear how cortical synchrony across a network is accomplished. Based on its anatomical connectivity with the cortex, we hypothesized that the pulvinar, a thalamic nucleus, regulates cortical synchrony. We mapped pulvino-cortical networks within the visual system, using diffusion tensor imaging, and simultaneously recorded spikes and field potentials from these interconnected network sites in monkeys performing a visuospatial attention task. The pulvinar synchronized activity between interconnected cortical areas according to attentional allocation, suggesting a critical role for the thalamus not only in attentional selection but more generally in regulating information transmission across the visual cortex.},

The present study aimed to investigate the relationship between hippocampal and VC LFP dynamics. Analysis of power spectral density revealed that LFP in the VC was similar to that in the hippocampus, but with lower overall magnitude. As running velocity increased, both the power and frequency of theta and its harmonics increased in the VC, similarly to what is observed in the hippocampus. Current source density analysis triggered to theta did not identify distinct current sources and sinks in the VC, supporting the idea that theta in the VC is conducted from the adjacent hippocampus. Phase coupling between theta, its harmonics, and gamma is a notable feature in the hippocampus, particularly in the lacunosum moleculare. While some evidence of coupling between theta and its harmonics in the VC was found, bicoherence estimates did not reveal significant phase coupling between theta and gamma. Similar results were seen in the cross-region bicoherence analysis, where theta showed strong coupling with its harmonics with increasing velocity. Thus, theta oscillations observed in the VC during running tasks are likely due to volume conduction from the hippocampus.},

Here, we show that simple visual stimuli reliably evoke two traveling waves with spatial wavelengths that cover much of the cerebral hemisphere in awake mice. 30-50 Hz feedforward waves arise in primary visual cortex (V1) and propagate rostrally, while 3-6 Hz feedback waves originate in the association cortex and flow caudally. The phase of the feedback wave modulates the amplitude of the feedforward wave and synchronizes firing between V1 and parietal cortex. Altogether, these results provide direct experimental evidence that visual evoked traveling waves percolate through the cerebral cortex and coordinate neuronal activity across broadly distributed networks mediating visual processing.},

    abstract         = {Field potentials (FPs) reflect neuronal activities in the brain, and often exhibit traveling peaks across recording sites. While traveling FPs are interpreted as propagation of neuronal activity, not all studies directly reveal such propagating patterns of neuronal activation. Neuronal activity is associated with transmembrane currents that form dipoles and produce negative and positive fields. Thereby, FP components reverse polarity between those fields and have minimal amplitudes at the center of dipoles. Although their amplitudes could be smaller, FPs are never flat even around these reversals. What occurs around the reversal has not been addressed explicitly, although those are rationally in the middle of active neurons. We show that sensory FPs around the reversal appeared with peaks traveling across cortical laminae in macaque sensory cortices. Interestingly, analyses of current source density did not depict traveling patterns but lamina-delimited current sinks and sources. We simulated FPs produced by volume conduction of a simplified 2 dipoles{\textquoteright} model mimicking sensory cortical laminar current source density components. While FPs generated by single dipoles followed the temporal patterns of the dipole moments without traveling peaks, FPs generated by concurrently active dipole moments appeared with traveling components in the vicinity of dipoles by superimposition of individually non-traveling FPs generated by single dipoles. These results indicate that not all traveling FP are generated by traveling neuronal activity, and that recording positions need to be taken into account to describe FP peak components around active neuronal populations.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Field potentials (FPs) generated by neuronal activity in the brain occur with fields of opposite polarity. Likewise, in the cerebral cortices, they have mirror-imaged waveforms in upper and lower layers. We show that FPs appear like traveling across the cortical layers. Interestingly, the traveling FPs occur without traveling components of current source density, which represents transmembrane currents associated with neuronal activity. These seemingly odd findings are explained using current source density models of multiple dipoles. Concurrently active, non-traveling dipoles produce FPs as mixtures of FPs produced by individual dipoles, and result in traveling FP waveforms as the mixing ratio depends on the distances from those dipoles. The results suggest that not all traveling FP components are associated with propagating neuronal activity.},

    abstract         = {Previous work demonstrated a highly reproducible cortical hierarchy of neural timescales at rest, with sensory areas displaying fast, and higher-order association areas displaying slower timescales. The question arises how such stable hierarchies give rise to adaptive behavior that requires flexible adjustment of temporal coding and integration demands. Potentially, this lack of variability in the hierarchical organization of neural timescales could reflect the structure of the laboratory contexts. We posit that unconstrained paradigms are ideal to test whether the dynamics of neural timescales reflect behavioral demands. Here we measured timescales of local field potential activity while male rhesus macaques foraged in an open space. We found a hierarchy of neural timescales that differs from previous work. Importantly, although the magnitude of neural timescales expanded with task engagement, the brain areas’ relative position in the hierarchy was stable. Next, we demonstrated that the change in neural timescales is dynamic and contains functionally-relevant information, differentiating between similar events in terms of motor demands and associated reward. Finally, we demonstrated that brain areas are differentially affected by these behavioral demands. These results demonstrate that while the space of neural timescales is anatomically constrained, the observed hierarchical organization and magnitude is dependent on behavioral demands.},

    abstract         = {Cortical dynamics obey a 1/f power law, exhibiting an exponential decay of spectral power with increasing frequency. The slope and offset of this 1/f decay reflect the timescale and magnitude of aperiodic neural activity, respectively. These properties are tightly linked to cellular and circuit mechanisms (e.g. excitation:inhibition balance and firing rates) as well as cognitive processes (e.g. perception, memory, and state). However, the physiology underlying the 1/f power law in cortical dynamics is not well understood. Here, we compared laminar recordings from human, macaque and mouse cortex to evaluate how 1/f aperiodic dynamics vary across cortical layers and species. We report that 1/f slope is steepest in superficial layers and flattest in deep layers in each species. Additionally, the magnitude of this 1/f decay is greatest in superficial cortex and decreases with depth. We could account for both of these findings with a simple model in which superficial cortical transmembrane currents had longer time constants and greater densities than those in deeper layers. Together, our results provide novel insight into the organization of cortical dynamics, suggesting that the amplitude and time constant of local currents control circuit processing as a function of laminar depth. This may represent a general mechanism to facilitate appropriate integration of fast sensory inputs (infragranular) with slow feedback-type inputs (supragranular) across cortical areas and species.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

In the present work, we identified an algorithmic neural substrate for modular computation through the study of multitasking artificial recurrent neural networks. Dynamical systems analyses revealed learned computational strategies mirroring the modular subtask structure of the training task set. Dynamical motifs, which are recurring patterns of neural activity that implement specific computations through dynamics, such as attractors, decision boundaries and rotations, were reused across tasks. For example, tasks requiring memory of a continuous circular variable repurposed the same ring attractor. We showed that dynamical motifs were implemented by clusters of units when the unit activation function was restricted to be positive. Cluster lesions caused modular performance deficits. Motifs were reconfigured for fast transfer learning after an initial phase of learning. This work establishes dynamical motifs as a fundamental unit of compositional computation, intermediate between neuron and network. As whole-brain studies simultaneously record activity from multiple specialized systems, the dynamical motif framework will guide questions about specialization and generalization.},

To test the performance of Kilosort, we developed a realistic simulation framework that uses densely sampled electrical fields from real experiments to generate nonstationary spike waveforms and realistic noise. We found that nearly all versions of Kilosort outperformed other algorithms on a variety of simulated conditions and that Kilosort4 performed best in all cases, correctly identifying even neurons with low amplitudes and small spatial extents in high drift conditions.},

    abstract         = {Many time series are naturally considered as a superposition of several oscillation components. For example, electroencephalogram (EEG) time series include oscillation components such as alpha, beta, and gamma. We propose a method for decomposing time series into such oscillation components using state-space models. Based on the concept of random frequency modulation, gaussian linear state-space models for oscillation components are developed. In this model, the frequency of an oscillator fluctuates by noise. Time series decomposition is accomplished by this model like the Bayesian seasonal adjustment method. Since the model parameters are estimated from data by the empirical Bayes’ method, the amplitudes and the frequencies of oscillation components are determined in a data-driven manner. Also, the appropriate number of oscillation components is determined with the Akaike information criterion (AIC). In this way, the proposed method provides a natural decomposition of the given time series into oscillation components. In neuroscience, the phase of neural time series plays an important role in neural information processing. The proposed method can be used to estimate the phase of each oscillation component and has several advantages over a conventional method based on the Hilbert transform. Thus, the proposed method enables an investigation of the phase dynamics of time series. Numerical results show that the proposed method succeeds in extracting intermittent oscillations like ripples and detecting the phase reset phenomena. We apply the proposed method to real data from various fields such as astronomy, ecology, tidology, and neuroscience.},

    abstract         = {Many of our daily activities, such as riding a bike to work or reading a book in a noisy cafe, and highly skilled activities, such as a professional playing a tennis match or a violin concerto, depend upon the ability of the brain to quickly make moment-to-moment adjustments to our behavior in response to the results of our actions. Particularly, they depend upon the ability of the neocortex to integrate the information provided by the sensory organs (bottom-up information) with internally generated signals such as expectations or attentional signals (top-down information). This integration occurs in pyramidal cells (PCs) and their long apical dendrite, which branches extensively into a dendritic tuft in layer 1 (L1). The outermost layer of the neocortex, L1 is highly conserved across cortical areas and species. Importantly, L1 is the predominant input layer for top-down information, relayed by a rich, dense mesh of long-range projections that provide signals to the tuft branches of the PCs. Here, we discuss recent progress in our understanding of the composition of L1 and review evidence that L1 processing contributes to functions such as sensory perception, cross-modal integration, controlling states of consciousness, attention, and learning.},

Here we review the cellular and synaptic mechanisms underlying gamma oscillations and outline empirical questions and controversial conceptual issues. Our main points are as follows: First, gamma-band rhythmogenesis is inextricably tied to perisomatic inhibition. Second, gamma oscillations are short-lived and typically emerge from the coordinated interaction of excitation and inhibition, which can be detected as local field potentials. Third, gamma rhythm typically concurs with irregular firing of single neurons, and the network frequency of gamma oscillations varies extensively depending on the underlying mechanism. To document gamma oscillations, efforts should be made to distinguish them from mere increases of gamma-band power and/or increased spiking activity. Fourth, the magnitude of gamma oscillation is modulated by slower rhythms. Such cross-frequency coupling may serve to couple active patches of cortical circuits. Because of their ubiquitous nature and strong correlation with the “operational modes” of local circuits, gamma oscillations continue to provide important clues about neuronal population dynamics in health and disease.},

How the deployment of spatial attention aids the hierarchical computations of object recognition remains unclear. We investigated this in the laminar cortical network of visual area V4, an area strongly modulated by attention. We found that deployment of attention strengthened unique dependencies in neural activity across cortical layers. On the other hand, shared dependencies were reduced within the excitatory population of a layer. Surprisingly, attention strengthened unique dependencies within a laminar population. Crucially, these modulation patterns were also observed during successful behavioral outcomes that are thought to be mediated by internal brain state fluctuations. Successful behavioral outcomes were also associated with phases of reduced neural excitability, suggesting a mechanism for enhanced information transfer during optimal states. Our results suggest common computation goals of optimal sensory states that are attained by either task demands or internal fluctuations.},

In the mammalian forebrain, one signature of such interacting circuit mechanisms is fast oscillatory dynamics, which can be reflected in the local field potential (LFP). We here used data from the Allen Neuropixels Visual Coding project to show that local visual features in naturalistic stimuli induce retinotopically specific V1 oscillations in various frequency bands. These LFP oscillations occurred in bursts, were localized to specific V1 layers, and were associated with phase coupling of V1 translaminar spiking, pointing to feature-specific circuit motifs. Finally, we discovered that these visually-induced circuit motifs occurred across a range of stimuli, suggesting that they might constitute general routes for feature-specific information flow. Together, our analyses demonstrate visually-induced, fast oscillations, which likely reflect the operation of distinct mesoscale circuits for the differential and multiplexed coding of complex visual input and feature-specific thalamo-cortical information propagation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

    abstract         = {The cortical column is one of the fundamental computational circuits in the brain. In order to understand the role neurons in different layers of this circuit play in cortical function it is necessary to identify the boundaries that separate the laminar compartments. While histological approaches can reveal ground truth they are not a practical means of identifying cortical layers in vivo. The gold standard for identifying laminar compartments in electrophysiological recordings is current-source density (CSD) analysis. However, laminar CSD analysis requires averaging across reliably evoked responses that target the input layer in cortex, which may be difficult to generate in less well-studied cortical regions. Further, the analysis can be susceptible to noise on individual channels resulting in errors in assigning laminar boundaries. Here, we have analyzed linear array recordings in multiple cortical areas in both the common marmoset and the rhesus macaque. We describe a pattern of laminar spike–field phase relationships that reliably identifies the transition between input and deep layers in cortical recordings from multiple cortical areas in two different non-human primate species. This measure corresponds well to estimates of the location of the input layer using CSDs, but does not require averaging or specific evoked activity. Laminar identity can be estimated rapidly with as little as a minute of ongoing data and is invariant to many experimental parameters. This method may serve to validate CSD measurements that might otherwise be unreliable or to estimate laminar boundaries when other methods are not practical.},

Using rare intracranial recordings in epilepsy patients, we find that alpha rhythms propagate toward the back of the brain and that alpha waves in cortex (particularly superficial layers) lead alpha oscillations in the thalamus. These findings shed light on how the human alpha rhythm coordinates activity throughout the brain. The alpha rhythm is the longest-studied brain oscillation and has been theorized to play a key role in cognition. Still, its physiology is poorly understood. In this study, we used microelectrodes and macroelectrodes in surgical epilepsy patients to measure the intracortical and thalamic generators of the alpha rhythm during quiet wakefulness. We first found that alpha in both visual and somatosensory cortex propagates from higher-order to lower-order areas. In posterior cortex, alpha propagates from higher-order anterosuperior areas toward the occipital pole, whereas alpha in somatosensory cortex propagates from associative regions toward primary cortex. Several analyses suggest that this cortical alpha leads pulvinar alpha, complicating prevailing theories of a thalamic pacemaker. Finally, alpha is dominated by currents and firing in supragranular cortical layers. Together, these results suggest that the alpha rhythm likely reflects short-range supragranular feedback, which propagates from higher- to lower-order cortex and cortex to thalamus. These physiological insights suggest how alpha could mediate feedback throughout the thalamocortical system.},

Yet, evidence from simulations have shown that analysis artefacts could also lead to spurious pre-stimulus oscillations that appear to predict future brain responses. To address this discrepancy, we conducted an experiment in which visual stimuli were presented in time to specific phases of spontaneous alpha and theta oscillations. This allowed us to causally probe the role of ongoing neural activity in visual processing independent of the stimulus-evoked dynamics. Our findings did not support a causal link between spontaneous alpha / theta rhythms and behaviour. However, spurious correlations between theta phase and behaviour emerged offline using gold-standard time-frequency analyses. These findings are a reminder that care should be taken when inferring causal relationships between neural activity and behaviour using acausal analysis methods.},

    abstract         = {In mouse primary visual cortex (V1), familiar stimuli evoke significantly altered responses when compared with novel stimuli. This stimulus-selective response plasticity (SRP) was described originally as an increase in the magnitude of visual evoked potentials (VEPs) elicited in layer 4 (L4) by familiar phase-reversing grating stimuli. SRP is dependent on NMDA receptors (NMDARs) and has been hypothesized to reflect potentiation of thalamocortical (TC) synapses in L4. However, recent evidence indicates that the synaptic modifications that manifest as SRP do not occur on L4 principal cells. To shed light on where and how SRP is induced and expressed in male and female mice, the present study had three related aims: (1) to confirm that NMDAR are required specifically in glutamatergic principal neurons of V1, (2) to investigate the consequences of deleting NMDAR specifically in L6, and (3) to use translaminar electrophysiological recordings to characterize SRP expression in different layers of V1. We find that knock-out (KO) of NMDAR in L6 principal neurons disrupts SRP. Current-source density (CSD) analysis of the VEP depth profile shows augmentation of short latency current sinks in layers 3, 4, and 6 in response to phase reversals of familiar stimuli. Multiunit recordings demonstrate that increased peak firing occurs in response to phase reversals of familiar stimuli across all layers, but that activity between phase reversals is suppressed. Together, these data reveal important aspects of the underlying phenomenology of SRP and generate new hypotheses for the expression of experience-dependent plasticity in V1.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Repeated exposure to stimuli that portend neither reward nor punishment leads to behavioral habituation, enabling organisms to dedicate attention to novel or otherwise significant features of the environment. The neural basis of this process, which is so often dysregulated in neurologic and psychiatric disorders, remains poorly understood. Learning and memory of stimulus familiarity can be studied in mouse visual cortex by measuring electrophysiological responses to simple phase-reversing grating stimuli. The current study advances knowledge of this process by documenting changes in visual evoked potentials (VEPs), neuronal spiking activity, and oscillations in the local field potentials (LFPs) across all layers of mouse visual cortex. In addition, we identify a key contribution of a specific population of neurons in layer 6 (L6) of visual cortex.},

    abstract         = {Time courses of neural responses underlie real-time sensory processing and perception. How these temporal dynamics change may be fundamental to how sensory systems adapt to different perceptual demands. By simultaneously recording from hundreds of neurons in mouse primary visual cortex, we examined neural population responses to visual stimuli at sub-second timescales, during different behavioural states. We discovered that during active behavioural states characterised by locomotion, single-neurons shift from transient to sustained response modes, facilitating rapid emergence of visual stimulus tuning. Differences in single-neuron response dynamics were associated with changes in temporal dynamics of neural correlations, including faster stabilisation of stimulus-evoked changes in the structure of correlations during locomotion. Using Factor Analysis, we examined temporal dynamics of latent population responses and discovered that trajectories of population activity make more direct transitions between baseline and stimulus-encoding neural states during locomotion. This could be partly explained by dampening of oscillatory dynamics present during stationary behavioural states. Functionally, changes in temporal response dynamics collectively enabled faster, more stable and more efficient encoding of new visual information during locomotion. These findings reveal a principle of how sensory systems adapt to perceptual demands, where flexible neural population dynamics govern the speed and stability of sensory encoding.},

However, the anatomical basis for these waves, and whether they are locally confined versus distributed across the brain, remains unclear. Here we use cortex-wide imaging and large-scale electrophysiology in awake mice to reveal the organization of traveling waves across spatial scales. Traveling waves formed spiral patterns predominantly centered on somatosensory cortex. Strikingly, the local axonal architecture of neurons in sensory cortex exhibited a matching circular arrangement. At the cortex-wide scale, these spiral waves were mirrored between hemispheres and between sensory and motor cortex, reflecting topographic long-range axons. Finally, at the brain-wide scale, cortical spiral waves were coordinated with subcortical spiking patterns in the thalamus, striatum and midbrain. These results establish that traveling waves are structured by axonal pathways and globally impact neural activity across diverse brain systems.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

    abstract         = {Working memory (WM) refers to the short-term maintenance of information with higher cognitive functions. Recent researches show that local field potentials (LFPs) and spikes, as different modes of neural signals, encode WM, respectively. There is a growing interest in how these two signals encode WM in coordination. The aim of this study is to investigate spike-LFP coupling coding of WM via the joint entropy analysis. The experimental data were multi-channel spikes and LFPs obtained from SD rat prefrontal cortex through the implanted microelectrode array during the WM tasks in Y-maze. The short-time Fourier transform (STFT) was applied to analyze the power changes of WM related frequency bands in the LFPs. The joint entropy indexes (JEIs) between spikes and the principle components of LFPs were calculated for each pair of the spike and the LFP series during WM. The results showed that the power of theta (4-12Hz), low gamma (LG, 30-60Hz) and high gamma band (HG, 60-100Hz) in LFPs increased during the WM tasks. In addition, the JEIs between spikes and LFPs components (theta, LG and HG) significantly increased in the correct trials. Besides, the coupling levels were low when the rats waiting in the starting area. These results suggest that the JEIs between spikes and LFPs components (theta, LG and HG) encode WM effectively. These findings could lead to improved understanding of the WM mechanism from the view of spike-LFP joint encoding.},

                        The brain exhibits distinct patterns of recurrent activity closely related to behavioral state. The neural mechanisms that underlie state-dependent activity in the awake animal are incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate that two types of state-dependent activity, rapid arousal/movement-related signals and a 3–5 Hz alpha-like rhythm, in the primary visual cortex (V1) of mice strongly correlate with activity in the visual thalamus. Inactivation of V1 does not interrupt arousal/movement signals in most visual thalamic neurons, but it abolishes the 3–5 Hz oscillation. Silencing of the visual thalamus similarly eradicates the alpha-like rhythm and perturbs arousal/movement-related activation in V1. Intracellular recordings in thalamic neurons reveal the 3–5 Hz oscillation to be associated with rhythmic low-threshold Ca2+ spikes. Our results indicate that thalamocortical interactions through ionotropic signaling, together with cell-intrinsic properties of thalamocortical cells, play a crucial role in shaping state-dependent activity in V1 of the awake animal.},

    abstract         = {The role of experience in the development and maintenance of emergent network properties such as cortical oscillations and states is poorly understood. To define how early-life experience affects cortical dynamics in the visual cortex of adult, head-fixed mice, we examined the effects of two forms of blindness initiated before eye opening and continuing through recording: (1) bilateral loss of retinal input (enucleation) and (2) degradation of visual input (eyelid suture). Neither form of deprivation fundamentally altered the state-dependent regulation of firing rates or local field potentials. However, each deprivation caused unique changes in network behavior. Laminar analysis revealed two different generative mechanisms for low-frequency synchronization: one prevalent during movement and the other during quiet wakefulness. The former was absent in enucleated mice, suggesting a mouse homolog of human alpha oscillations. In addition, neurons in enucleated animals were less correlated and fired more regularly, but no change in mean firing rate. Eyelid suture decreased firing rates during quiet wakefulness, but not during movement, with no effect on neural correlations or regularity. Sutured animals showed a broadband increase in depth EEG power and an increased occurrence, but reduced central frequency, of narrowband gamma oscillations. The complementary{\textemdash}rather than additive{\textemdash}effects of lid suture and enucleation suggest that the development of emergent network properties does not require vision but is plastic to modified input. Our results suggest a complex interaction of internal set points and experience determines mature cortical activity, with low-frequency synchronization being particularly susceptible to early deprivation.},

The wide availability of high-density electrical and magnetic recordings (64–256 channels) over the past two decades has allowed for renewed efforts in the characterization and localization of these rhythms. A variety of cognitive effects that are associated with specific brain oscillations have been reported, which range in spectral, temporal, and spatial characteristics depending on the context. Our laboratory has focused on investigating the role of alpha-band oscillatory activity (8–14 Hz) as a potential attentional suppression mechanism, and this particular oscillatory attention mechanism will be the focus of the current review. We discuss findings in the context of intersensory selective attention as well as intrasensory spatial and feature-based attention in the visual, auditory, and tactile domains. The weight of evidence suggests that alpha-band oscillations can be actively invoked within cortical regions across multiple sensory systems, particularly when these regions are involved in processing irrelevant or distracting information. That is, a central role for alpha seems to be as an attentional suppression mechanism when objects or features need to be specifically ignored or selected against.</p>},

This is accomplished by sorting, directing, and integrating the complex network of excitatory inputs that converge onto L1. These signals are combined with neuromodulatory afferents and gated by the wealth of inhibitory interneurons that either are embedded within L1 or send axons from other cortical layers. Together, these interactions dynamically calibrate information flow throughout the neocortex.

Here we investigate this link by mathematical modeling of contributions to the LFP from a single layer-5 pyramidal neuron and a single layer-4 stellate neuron receiving synaptic input. An intrinsic dendritic low-pass filtering effect of the LFP signal, previously demonstrated for extracellular signatures of action potentials, is seen to strongly affect the LFP power spectra, even for frequencies as low as 10 Hz for the example pyramidal neuron. Further, the LFP signal is found to depend sensitively on both the recording position and the position of the synaptic input: the LFP power spectra recorded close to the active synapse are typically found to be less low-pass filtered than spectra recorded further away. Some recording positions display striking band-pass characteristics of the LFP. The frequency dependence of the properties of the current dipole moment set up by the synaptic input current is found to qualitatively account for several salient features of the observed LFP. Two approximate schemes for calculating the LFP, the dipole approximation and the two-monopole approximation, are tested and found to be potentially useful for translating results from large-scale neural network models into predictions for results from electroencephalographic (EEG) or electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings.},

    abstract         = {Understanding the computational mechanisms that underlie the encoding and decoding of environmental stimuli is a crucial investigation in neuroscience. Central to this pursuit is the exploration of how the brain represents visual information across its hierarchical architecture. A prominent challenge resides in discerning the neural underpinnings of the processing of dynamic natural visual scenes. Although considerable research efforts have been made to characterize individual components of the visual pathway, a systematic understanding of the distinctive neural coding associated with visual stimuli, as they traverse this hierarchical landscape, remains elusive. In this study, we leverage the comprehensive Allen Visual Coding—Neuropixels dataset and utilize the capabilities of deep learning neural network models to study neural coding in response to dynamic natural visual scenes across an expansive array of brain regions. Our study reveals that our decoding model adeptly deciphers visual scenes from neural spiking patterns exhibited within each distinct brain area. A compelling observation arises from the comparative analysis of decoding performances, which manifests as a notable encoding proficiency within the visual cortex and subcortical nuclei, in contrast to a relatively reduced encoding activity within hippocampal neurons. Strikingly, our results unveil a robust correlation between our decoding metrics and well-established anatomical and functional hierarchy indexes. These findings corroborate existing knowledge in visual coding related to artificial visual stimuli and illuminate the functional role of these deeper brain regions using dynamic stimuli. Consequently, our results suggest a novel perspective on the utility of decoding neural network models as a metric for quantifying the encoding quality of dynamic natural visual scenes represented by neural responses, thereby advancing our comprehension of visual coding within the complex hierarchy of the brain.},

    abstract         = {The primate visual system continuously selects spatial proscribed regions, features or objects for further processing. These selection mechanisms{\textemdash}collectively termed selective visual attention{\textemdash}are guided by intrinsic, bottom-up and by task-dependent, top-down signals. While much psychophysical research has shown that overt and covert attention is partially allocated based on saliency-driven exogenous signals, it is unclear how this is accomplished at the neuronal level. Recent electrophysiological experiments in monkeys point to the gradual emergence of saliency signals when ascending the dorsal visual stream and to the influence of top-down attention on these signals. To elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying these observations, we construct a biologically plausible network of spiking neurons to simulate the formation of saliency signals in different cortical areas. We find that saliency signals are rapidly generated through lateral excitation and inhibition in successive layers of neural populations selective to a single feature. These signals can be improved by feedback from a higher cortical area that represents a saliency map. In addition, we show how top-down attention can affect the saliency signals by disrupting this feedback through its action on the saliency map. While we find that saliency computations require dominant slow NMDA currents, the signal rapidly emerges from successive regions of the network. In conclusion, using a detailed spiking network model we find biophysical mechanisms and limitations of saliency computations which can be tested experimentally.},

The concept of a ‘saliency map’ topographically encoding stimulus conspicuity over the visual scene has proven to be an efficient predictor of eye movements. Our work reviews insights into the neurobiological implementation of visual salience computation. We start by summarizing the role that different visual brain areas play in salience computation, whether at the level of feature analysis for bottom-up salience or at the level of goal-directed priority maps for output behaviour. We then delve into how a subcortical structure, the superior colliculus (SC), participates in salience computation. The SC represents a visual saliency map via a centre-surround inhibition mechanism in the superficial layers, which feeds into priority selection mechanisms in the deeper layers, thereby affecting saccadic and microsaccadic eye movements. Lateral interactions in the local SC circuit are particularly important for controlling active populations of neurons. This, in turn, might help explain long-range effects, such as those of peripheral cues on tiny microsaccades. Finally, we show how a combination of in vitro neurophysiology and large-scale computational modelling is able to clarify how salience computation is implemented in the local circuit of the SC.

This includes both bottom-up (world statistics) signals mediated by sensory cortex, association cortex, and subcortical structures, as well as top-down (goal and task) influences which arrive via either direct excitatory pathways from cerebral cortex, or via indirect basal ganglia relays resulting in inhibition or dis-inhibition as appropriate for alternative behaviors. Models of attention such as saliency maps serve as convenient frameworks to organize our understanding of both the separate computations of each neural pathway, as well as the interaction between the multiple parallel pathways influencing gaze. While the spatial interactions between gaze’s neural pathways are relatively well understood, the temporal interactions between and within pathways will be an important area of future study, requiring both improved technical methods for measurement and improvement of our understanding of how temporal dynamics results in the observed spatiotemporal allocation of gaze.},

                        Visual cortical areas subserve cognitive functions by interacting in both feedforward and feedback directions. While feedforward influences convey sensory signals, feedback influences modulate feedforward signaling according to the current behavioral context. We investigated whether these interareal influences are subserved differentially by rhythmic synchronization. We correlated frequency-specific directed influences among 28 pairs of visual areas with anatomical metrics of the feedforward or feedback character of the respective interareal projections. This revealed that in the primate visual system, feedforward influences are carried by theta-band (∼4 Hz) and gamma-band (∼60–80 Hz) synchronization, and feedback influences by beta-band (∼14–18 Hz) synchronization. The functional directed influences constrain a functional hierarchy similar to the anatomical hierarchy, but exhibiting task-dependent dynamic changes in particular with regard to the hierarchical positions of frontal areas. Our results demonstrate that feedforward and feedback signaling use distinct frequency channels, suggesting that they subserve differential communication requirements.},

    abstract         = {Low-frequency membrane potential (Vm) oscillations were once thought to only occur in sleeping and anesthetized states. Recently, low-frequency Vm oscillations have been described in inactive awake animals, but it is unclear whether they shape sensory processing in neurons and whether they occur during active awake behavioral states. To answer these questions, we performed two-photon guided whole-cell Vm recordings from primary visual cortex layer 2/3 excitatory and inhibitory neurons in awake mice during passive visual stimulation and performance of visual and auditory discrimination tasks. We recorded stereotyped 3{\textendash}5 Hz Vm oscillations where the Vm baseline hyperpolarized as the Vm underwent high amplitude rhythmic fluctuations lasting 1{\textendash}2 s in duration. When 3{\textendash}5 Hz Vm oscillations coincided with visual cues, excitatory neuron responses to preferred cues were significantly reduced. Despite this disruption to sensory processing, visual cues were critical for evoking 3{\textendash}5 Hz Vm oscillations when animals performed discrimination tasks and passively viewed drifting grating stimuli. Using pupillometry and animal locomotive speed as indicators of arousal, we found that 3{\textendash}5 Hz oscillations were not restricted to unaroused states and that they occurred equally in aroused and unaroused states. Therefore, low-frequency Vm oscillations play a role in shaping sensory processing in visual cortical neurons, even during active wakefulness and decision making.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT A neuron{\textquoteright}s membrane potential (Vm) strongly shapes how information is processed in sensory cortices of awake animals. Yet, very little is known about how low-frequency Vm oscillations influence sensory processing and whether they occur in aroused awake animals. By performing two-photon guided whole-cell recordings from layer 2/3 excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the visual cortex of awake behaving animals, we found visually evoked stereotyped 3{\textendash}5 Hz Vm oscillations that disrupt excitatory responsiveness to visual stimuli. Moreover, these oscillations occurred when animals were in high and low arousal states as measured by animal speed and pupillometry. These findings show, for the first time, that low-frequency Vm oscillations can significantly modulate sensory signal processing, even in awake active animals.},

We offer a resolution of this debate; we show that two important dynamical regimes, typically considered incompatible, can coexist in the same local cortical circuit by separating them into two different subspaces. In awake mouse motor cortex, we find a low-dimensional subspace with large fluctuations consistent with criticality—a dynamical regime with moderate correlations and multi-scale information capacity and transmission. Orthogonal to this critical subspace, we find a high-dimensional subspace containing a desynchronized dynamical regime, which may optimize input discrimination. The critical subspace is apparent only at long timescales, which explains discrepancies among some previous studies. Using a computational model, we show that the emergence of a low-dimensional critical subspace at large timescales agrees with established theory of critical dynamics. Our results suggest that the cortex leverages its high dimensionality to multiplex dynamical regimes across different subspaces. Temporal coarse-graining reveals a low-dimensional critical subspace coexistent with a desynchronized subspace in awake cortex.},

The electric fields, in turn, can act as “guard rails” that funnel higher dimensional variable neural activity along stable lower dimensional routes. We obtained the latent space associated with each memory. We then confirmed the stability of the electric field by mapping the latent space to different cortical patches (that comprise a neural ensemble) and reconstructing information flow between patches. Stable electric fields can allow latent states to be transferred between brain areas, in accord with modern engram theory.},

Primary visual cortex (V1) neurons responded to illusory gratings, matching their direction selectivity for real gratings, and they tracked the spatial phase offset between illusory and real gratings. Illusion responses were delayed compared to real gratings, in line with the theory that processing illusions requires feedback from higher visual areas (HVAs). We provide support for this theory by showing a reduced V1 response to illusions, but not real gratings, following HVAs optogenetic inhibition. Finally, we used the pupil response (PR) as an indirect perceptual report and showed that the mouse PR matches the human PR to perceived luminance changes. Our findings resolve debates over whether V1 neurons are involved in processing illusions and highlight the involvement of feedback from HVAs.},

  abstract         = {γ Band plays a key role in the encoding of visual features in the primary visual cortex (V1). In rodents V1 two ranges within the γ band are sensitive to contrast: a broad γ band (BB) increasing with contrast, and a narrow γ band (NB), peaking at \~{}60 Hz, decreasing with contrast. The functional roles of the two bands and the neural circuits originating them are not completely clear yet. Here, we show, combining experimental and simulated data, that in mice V1 (1) BB carries information about high contrast and NB about low contrast; (2) BB modulation depends on excitatory-inhibitory interplay in the cortex, while NB modulation is because of entrainment to the thalamic drive. In awake mice presented with alternating gratings, NB power progressively decreased from low to intermediate levels of contrast where it reached a plateau. Conversely, BB power was constant across low levels of contrast, but it progressively increased from intermediate to high levels of contrast. Furthermore, BB response was stronger immediately after contrast reversal, while the opposite held for NB. These complementary modulations were reproduced by a recurrent excitatory-inhibitory leaky integrate-and-fire network provided that the thalamic inputs were composed of a sustained and a periodic component having complementary sensitivity ranges. These results show that in rodents the thalamic-driven NB plays a specific key role in encoding visual contrast. Moreover, we propose a simple and effective network model of response to visual stimuli in rodents that might help in investigating network dysfunctions of pathologic visual information processing.},

  abstract         = {Electrode grids on the cortical surface of epileptic patients provide a unique opportunity to observe brain activity with high temporal{\textendash}spatial resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio during a cognitive task. Previous work showed that large-amplitude theta frequency oscillations occurred intermittently during a maze navigation task, but it was unclear whether theta related to the spatial or working memory components of the task. To determine whether theta occurs during a nonspatial task, we made recordings while subjects performed the Sternberg working memory task. Our results show event-related theta and reveal a new phenomenon, the cognitive {\textquotedblleft}gating{\textquotedblright} of a brain oscillation: at many cortical sites, the amplitude of theta oscillations increased dramatically at the start of the trial, continued through all phases of the trial, including the delay period, and decreased sharply at the end. Gating could be seen in individual trials and varying the duration of the trial systematically varied the period of gating. These results suggest that theta oscillations could have an important role in organizing multi-item working memory.},

The analysis reveals a rich repertoire of states, including synchronous states in which neurons fire regularly; asynchronous states with stationary global activity and very irregular individual cell activity; and states in which the global activity oscillates but individual cells fire irregularly, typically at rates lower than the global oscillation frequency. The network can switch between these states, provided the external frequency, or the balance between excitation and inhibition, is varied. Two types of network oscillations are observed. In the fast oscillatory state, the network frequency is almost fully controlled by the synaptic time scale. In the slow oscillatory state, the network frequency depends mostly on the membrane time constant. Finite size effects in the asynchronous state are also discussed.},

  abstract         = {In recent years, many new cortical areas have been identified in the macaque monkey. The number of iden tified connections hetween areas has increased even more dramatically. We report here on (1) a summary of the layout of cortical areas associated with vision and with other modalities, (2) a computerized database for storing and representing large amounts of information on connectivity patterns, and (3) the application of these data to the analysis of hierarchical organization of the cerebral cortex. Our analysis concentrates on the visual system, which includes 25 neocortical areas that are predominantly or exclusively visual in function, plus an additional 7 areas that we regard as visual-association areas on the basis of their extensive visual inputs. A total of 305 connections among these 32 visual and visual-association areas have been reported. This represents 31% of the possible number of pathways it each area were connected with all others. The actual degree of connectivity is likely to he closer to 40%. The great majority of pathways involve reciprocal connections be tween areas. There are also extensive connections with cortical areas outside the visual system proper, including the somatosensory cortex, as well as neocortical, transitional, and archicortical regions in the temporal and frontal lobes. In the somatosensory/motor system, there are 62 identified pathways linking 13 cortical areas, suggesting an overall connectivity of about 40%. Based on the laminar patterns of connections between areas, we propose a hierarchy of visual areas and of somato sensory/motor areas that is more comprehensive thao those suggested in other recent studies. The current version of the visual hierarchy includes 10 levels of cortical processing. Altogether, it contains 14 levels if one includes the retina and lateral geniculate nucleus at the bottom as well as the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus at the top. Within this hierarchy, there are multiple, intertwined processing streams, which, at a low level, are related to the compartmental organization of areas V1 and V2 and, at a high level, are related to the distinction between processing centers in the temporal and parietal lobes. However, there are some pathways and relationships (about 10% of the total) whose descriptions do not fit cleanly into this hierarchical scheme for one reason or another. In most instances, though, it is unclear whether these represent genuine exceptions to a strict hierarchy rather than inaccuracies or uncertainties in the reported assignment.},

However, the adoption of this approach to human scalp electroencephalography (EEG) has been more limited, despite the ability of this methodology to quantify canonical neuronal processes. Here, we provide evidence that theta band activities over the midfrontal cortex appear to reflect a common computation used for realizing the need for cognitive control. Moreover, by virtue of inherent properties of field oscillations, these theta band processes may be used to communicate this need and subsequently implement such control across disparate brain regions. Thus, frontal theta is a compelling candidate mechanism by which emergent processes, such as ‘cognitive control’, may be biophysically realized.},

  abstract         = {To support a range of behaviours, the brain must flexibly coordinate neural activity across widespread brain regions. One potential mechanism for this coordination is a travelling wave, in which a neural oscillation propagates across the brain while organizing the order and timing of activity across regions. Although travelling waves are present across the brain in various species, their potential functional relevance has remained unknown. Here, using rare direct human brain recordings, we demonstrate a distinct functional role for travelling waves of theta- and alpha-band (2-13 Hz) oscillations in the cortex. Travelling waves propagate in different directions during separate cognitive processes. In episodic memory, travelling waves tended to propagate in a posterior-to-anterior direction during successful memory encoding and in an anterior-to-posterior direction during recall. Because travelling waves of oscillations correspond to local neuronal spiking, these patterns indicate that rhythmic pulses of activity move across the brain in different directions for separate behaviours. More broadly, our results suggest a fundamental role for travelling waves and oscillations in dynamically coordinating neural connectivity, by flexibly organizing the timing and directionality of network interactions across the cortex to support cognition and behaviour.},

  abstract         = {Retaining information in working memory is a demanding process that relies on cognitive control to protect memoranda-specific persistent activity from interference1,2. However, how cognitive control regulates working memory storage is unclear. Here we show that interactions of frontal control and hippocampal persistent activity are coordinated by theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling (TG-PAC). We recorded single neurons in the human medial temporal and frontal lobe while patients maintained multiple items in their working memory. In the hippocampus, TG-PAC was indicative of working memory load and quality. We identified cells that selectively spiked during nonlinear interactions of theta phase and gamma amplitude. The spike timing of these PAC neurons was coordinated with frontal theta activity when cognitive control demand was high. By introducing noise correlations with persistently active neurons in the hippocampus, PAC neurons shaped the geometry of the population code. This led to higher-fidelity representations of working memory content that were associated with improved behaviour. Our results support a multicomponent architecture of working memory1,2, with frontal control managing maintenance of working memory content in storage-related areas3-5. Within this framework, hippocampal TG-PAC integrates cognitive control and working memory storage across brain areas, thereby suggesting a potential mechanism for top-down control over sensory-driven processes.},

At present, even the most advanced artificial intelligence-based systems are unable to replicate the multisensory processes that the human brain routinely performs, but how neural circuits in the brain carry out these processes is still not well understood. In this Perspective, we discuss recent findings that shed fresh light on the oscillatory neural mechanisms that mediate multisensory integration (MI), including power modulations, phase resetting, phase-amplitude coupling and dynamic functional connectivity. We then consider studies that also suggest multi-timescale dynamics in intrinsic ongoing neural activity and during stimulus-driven bottom-up and cognitive top-down neural network processing in the context of MI. We propose a new concept of MI that emphasizes the critical role of neural dynamics at multiple timescales within and across brain networks, enabling the simultaneous integration, segregation, hierarchical structuring and selection of information in different time windows. To highlight predictions from our multi-timescale concept of MI, real-world scenarios in which multi-timescale processes may coordinate MI in a flexible and adaptive manner are considered.},

We show that different types of neural oscillators and cross-frequency interactions yield distinct signatures in neural dynamics. Finally, we associate these mechanisms with several putative functions of cross-frequency coupling, including neural representations of multiple environmental items, communication over distant areas, internal clocking of neural processes, and modulation of neural processing based on temporal predictions.},

We review the recent findings on how timescales of sensory and reward integration are affected by the temporal properties of sensory and reward signals in the environment. Despite existing evidence linking behavioral and neuronal timescales, future studies must examine how neural computations at multiple timescales are adjusted and combined to influence behavior flexibly.},

However, individual neurons do not function in isolation; they interact with each other in circuits to process information. Luo attempted to synthesize different types of investigations to extract generalized principles underlying how neurons communicate with each other through specific patterns of synaptic connectivity. Although different elements of the projection motifs and architectural plans have been discussed separately in the past, these motifs and architectures can now be brought together in the same intellectual framework. —PRS A review explains that the brain’s cortical and subcortical neuronal circuits show general connectivity features. Although individual neurons are the basic unit of the nervous system, they process information by working together in neuronal circuits with specific patterns of synaptic connectivity. Here, I review common circuit motifs and architectural plans used in diverse brain regions and animal species. I also consider how these circuit architectures assemble during development and might have evolved. Understanding how specific patterns of synaptic connectivity can implement specific neural computations will help to bridge the huge gap between the biology of the individual neuron and the function of the entire brain, allow us to better understand the neural basis of behavior, and may inspire new advances in artificial intelligence.},

We revisit the established idea that message passing among hierarchical cortical areas implements a form of Bayesian inference--paying careful attention to the implications for intrinsic connections among neuronal populations. By deriving canonical forms for these computations, one can associate specific neuronal populations with specific computational roles. This analysis discloses a remarkable correspondence between the microcircuitry of the cortical column and the connectivity implied by predictive coding. Furthermore, it provides some intuitive insights into the functional asymmetries between feedforward and feedback connections and the characteristic frequencies over which they operate.},

  abstract         = {Synchronous rhythms represent a core mechanism for sculpting temporal coordination of neural activity in the brain-wide network. This review focuses on oscillations in the cerebral cortex that occur during cognition, in alert behaving conditions. Over the last two decades, experimental and modeling work has made great strides in elucidating the detailed cellular and circuit basis of these rhythms, particularly gamma and theta rhythms. The underlying physiological mechanisms are diverse (ranging from resonance and pacemaker properties of single cells to multiple scenarios for population synchronization and wave propagation), but also exhibit unifying principles. A major conceptual advance was the realization that synaptic inhibition plays a fundamental role in rhythmogenesis, either in an interneuronal network or in a reciprocal excitatory-inhibitory loop. Computational functions of synchronous oscillations in cognition are still a matter of debate among systems neuroscientists, in part because the notion of regular oscillation seems to contradict the common observation that spiking discharges of individual neurons in the cortex are highly stochastic and far from being clocklike. However, recent findings have led to a framework that goes beyond the conventional theory of coupled oscillators and reconciles the apparent dichotomy between irregular single neuron activity and field potential oscillations. From this perspective, a plethora of studies will be reviewed on the involvement of long-distance neuronal coherence in cognitive functions such as multisensory integration, working memory, and selective attention. Finally, implications of abnormal neural synchronization are discussed as they relate to mental disorders like schizophrenia and autism.},

We here propose that information is gated by inhibiting task-irrelevant regions, thus routing information to task-relevant regions. The functional inhibition is reflected in oscillatory activity in the alpha band (8–13 Hz). From a physiological perspective the alpha activity provides pulsed inhibition reducing the processing capabilities of a given area. Active processing in the engaged areas is reflected by neuronal synchronization in the gamma band (30–100 Hz) accompanied by an alpha band decrease. According to this framework the brain could be studied as a network by investigating cross-frequency interactions between gamma and alpha activity. Specifically the framework predicts that optimal task performance will correlate with alpha activity in task-irrelevant areas. In this review we will discuss the empirical support for this framework. Given that alpha activity is by far the strongest signal recorded by EEG and MEG, we propose that a major part of the electrophysiological activity detected from the working brain reflects gating by inhibition.</p>},

The current sources and sinks form dipoles or higher-order n-poles.Extracellular currents arise from many sources, including synaptic currents, fast action potentials and their afterpotentials, calcium spikes and voltage-dependent intrinsic currents.The magnitude of extracellular currents depends critically on two factors: the cytoarchitectural organization of a network and the temporal synchrony of the various current sinks and sources.Depending on the recording method, neuroscientists distinguish between electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocorticogram (ECoG) and local field potential (LFP; also known as micro-, depth or intracranial EEG), although all of these measures refer to the same biophysical process.The electric field is the force 'felt' by an electric charge, and can be transmitted through brain volume. The extent of volume conduction depends on the relationships between the current dipole and the features of the conductive medium.High-density sampling of the extracellular field with contemporary methods enables the calculation of current source density, and therefore the localization of current sinks and sources.The voltage gradients generated by highly synchronous activity of neuronal groups can affect the transmembrane potential of the member neurons and alter their excitability through ephaptic coupling.Synchronous spiking of nearby neurons is the main source of the high-frequency components of the local field.There is a discernable relationship between the temporal evolution of cell assemblies and the time-dependent changes of the spatially distributed currents. High-density, wide-band recordings of the local field can therefore provide access to both afferent inputs and the spiking output of neurons.},

  abstract         = {While there is much knowledge about local neuronal circuitry, considerably less is known about how neuronal input is integrated and combined across neuronal networks to encode higher order brain functions. One challenge lies in the large number of complex neural interactions. Neural networks use oscillating activity for information exchange between distributed nodes. To better understand building principles underlying the observation of synchronized oscillatory activity in a large-scale network, we developed a reductionistic neuronal network model. Fundamental building principles are laterally and temporally interconnected virtual nodes (microcircuits), wherein each node was modeled as a local oscillator. By this building principle, the neuronal network model can integrate information in time and space. The simulation gives rise to a wave interference pattern that spreads over all simulated columns in form of a travelling wave. The model design stabilizes states of efficient information processing across all participating neuronal equivalents. Model-specific oscillatory patterns, generated by complex input stimuli, were similar to electrophysiological high-frequency signals that we could confirm in the primate visual cortex during a visual perception task. Important oscillatory model pre-runners, limitations and strength of our reductionistic model are discussed. Our simple scalable model shows unique integration properties and successfully reproduces a variety of biological phenomena such as harmonics, coherence patterns, frequency-speed relationships, and oscillatory activities. We suggest that our scalable model simulates aspects of a basic building principle underlying oscillatory, large-scale integration of information in small and large brains.},

  abstract         = {Summary Traveling waves of neural activity are frequently observed to occur in concert with the presentation of a sensory stimulus or the execution of a movement. Although such waves have been studied for decades, little is known about their function. Here we show that traveling waves in the primate extrastriate visual cortex provide a means of integrating sensory and motor signals. Specifically, we describe a traveling wave of local field potential (LFP) activity in cortical area V4 of macaque monkeys that is triggered by the execution of saccadic eye movements. These waves sweep across the V4 retinotopic map, following a consistent path from the foveal to the peripheral representations of space; their amplitudes correlate with the direction and size of each saccade. Moreover, these waves are associated with a reorganization of the postsaccadic neuronal firing patterns, which follow a similar retinotopic progression, potentially prioritizing the processing of behaviorally relevant stimuli.},

  abstract         = {We present a unique, extensive, and open synaptic physiology analysis platform and dataset. Through its application, we reveal principles that relate cell type to synaptic properties and intralaminar circuit organization in the mouse and human cortex. The dynamics of excitatory synapses align with the postsynaptic cell subclass, whereas inhibitory synapse dynamics partly align with presynaptic cell subclass but with considerable overlap. Synaptic properties are heterogeneous in most subclass-to-subclass connections. The two main axes of heterogeneity are strength and variability. Cell subclasses divide along the variability axis, whereas the strength axis accounts for substantial heterogeneity within the subclass. In the human cortex, excitatory-to-excitatory synaptic dynamics are distinct from those in the mouse cortex and vary with depth across layers 2 and 3. Insights into the organization and dynamics of local neocortical circuits are central to our understanding of brain processing. Neither macroscopic connectome analyses nor ultramicroscopic connectome studies provide such information. Using slice electrophysiology, Campagnola et al. collected a very large dataset to study the organization of cortical microcircuits in mice and humans. They analyzed the strength and probability of chemical and electrical connections; the latency and kinetic properties of synaptic responses; and cell classification features such as morphology, intrinsic physiology, transgenic markers, and cortical layer. The authors also modeled quantal release and short-term plasticity. Synaptic variability was a primary driver of cross-subclass differences. Compared with the connections in mice, human excitatory synapses had lower variability. —PRS The temporal dynamics of interneuronal connections and local connectivity are analyzed in mouse and human brain slices.},

  abstract         = {Theta is an extensively studied oscillation of the nervous system, but there is only a paucity of reviews on the subject. A review of specifically the cognitive-affective correlates of the theta oscillation is currently unavailable. The present review aims to fill this gap. This review shows that theta-based hippocampal binding brings together the environmentally triggered multimodal elements of episodes or scenes, make multimodal sensory/perceptual and motor processing, facilitatory and inhibitory attention, navigation and episodic memory possible. Hippocampus is centrally located in a selectively distributed theta network. The association between different sources of information and between oscillations of different frequency bands, the connectivity in the theta network and coherences between selected brain areas contribute to the synchrony and hypersynchrony in the human brain. The densely associated pool of information that are represented by the theta oscillation travel over this densely interconnected, and highly synchronized hippocampal-cortical system. In this network, the theta-based cortico-hippocampal interplay produces many cognitive-affective processes, chief one being memory with its encoding, consolidation and retrieval stages. The present review does not make a comparative evaluation of the theta over the evolutionary spectrum; it is focused on the hippocampal-cortical system, and does not consider the subcortical and brain stem structures of the theta network; and among the many different types of memory, treats specifically the episodic memory. Future theta reviews may choose to also treat these issues. Providing a concise exposition of the currently available empirical findings and theoretical formulations, this state-of-the art that review may stimulate research, make new conclusions available, and lead to creative syntheses, allowing a detailed understanding of the contribution of the theta oscillation to the whole-brain work and to the human mind.},

Within each theta cycle, items that are extended in representational space are scanned by traveling waves. Such scanning might go across small numbers of simple items linked into a chunk.},

  abstract         = {Gamma oscillations (30-90 Hz) in the brain are known to have an evident relationship with many cognitive processes. Computational models are promising tools for understanding the fundamental mechanisms of oscillatory dynamics and related functions. Early modeling works have devoted to understanding PING (Pyramidal Interneuron Network Gamma) and ING (Interneuron Network Gamma) rhythms, which have been supported by substantial experimental evidence. Despite these achievements, a number of works continue to investigate gamma rhythms focusing on various issues such as the role of resonators in network dynamics, mechanisms for the cross-frequency coupling phenomenon, and data-driven modeling approaches. However, computational models can be developed in various ways, thus making model development a process of great flexibility. Typically, models used for the study of neural oscillations involve spiking network oscillators and neural mass oscillators, while the former can further be classified as biologically realistic and simplified dynamic types according to distinct model developing principles. In this work, we provide a review of recent computational models for gamma oscillations according to different modeling strategies for the study of the above mentioned issues. We conclude that while both spiking neuronal networks and neural mass models are powerful in providing mechanistic insights, the simplicity of neural mass oscillators makes them amenable to dynamic analysis tools and data-fitting approaches, for which reason they may be more productive in relevant studies. Moreover, with rapid developments in neural measuring techniques at multiple scales, it is expected that the theory and methods of computational models across all scales will progress to deepen our understanding of gamma oscillations.},

These solutions (and freely-available computer code) make the model easy to apply to both binary and multiple choice situations. Using data from five previously published experiments, we demonstrate that the LBA model successfully accommodates empirical phenomena from binary and multiple choice tasks that have proven difficult for other theoretical accounts.

Although there has been some exploration of the characteristics of inhibition of saccadic return (ISR), the exact mechanisms by which ISR operates are currently unknown. In the framework of accumulation models of response times, in which evidence is integrated over time to a response threshold, ISR could reflect a reduction in the rate of accumulation for saccades to return locations or an increase in the effective criterion for response. In two experiments, participants generated sequences of three saccades, in response to a peripheral or a central cue. ISR occurred across these manipulations: saccade latency was consistently increased for movements to the immediately previously fixated location. Latency distributions from individual observers were fit with a Linear Ballistic Accumulator model. ISR was best accounted for as a change in the accumulation rate. We suggest this parameter represents the overall desirability of a particular course of action, the evidence for which may be derived from a variety of sensory and non-sensory sources.},

These fixational eye movements are classified as slow components (physiological drift, tremor) and microsaccades, which represent rapid, small-amplitude movements. Here we propose an integrated mathematical model for the generation of slow fixational eye movements and microsaccades. The model is based on the concept of self-avoiding random walks in a potential, a process driven by a self-generated activation field. The self-avoiding walk generates persistent movements on a short timescale, whereas, on a longer timescale, the potential produces antipersistent motions that keep the eye close to an intended fixation position. We introduce microsaccades as fast movements triggered by critical activation values. As a consequence, both slow movements and microsaccades follow the same law of motion; i.e., movements are driven by the self-generated activation field. Thus, the model contributes a unified explanation of why it has been a long-standing problem to separate slow movements and microsaccades with respect to their motion-generating principles. We conclude that the concept of a self-avoiding random walk captures fundamental properties of fixational eye movements and provides a coherent theoretical framework for two physiologically distinct movement types.},

We highlight approaches to characterize nonsinusoidal features and account for them in traditional spectral analysis. Instead of being a nuisance, we discuss how these nonsinusoidal features may provide crucial and so far overlooked physiological information related to neural communication, computation, and cognition.},

To provide a road map towards an improved mechanistic understanding of CFC, we organize the available and potential novel statistical/modeling approaches according to their biophysical interpretability. While we do not provide solutions for all the problems described, we provide a list of practical recommendations to avoid common errors and to enhance the interpretability of CFC analysis.},

In particular, measures quantifying the coupling between the phase of slow oscillations and the amplitude of fast oscillations have been applied to a wide range of data recorded from animals and humans. Some of the measures applied to detect phase-amplitude coupling have been criticized for being sensitive to nonsinusoidal properties of the oscillations and thus spuriously indicate the presence of coupling. While such instances of spurious identification of coupling have been observed, in this commentary we give concrete examples illustrating cases when the identification of cross-frequency coupling can be trusted. These examples are based on control analyses and empirical observations rather than signal-processing tools. Finally, we provide concrete advice on how to determine when measures of phase-amplitude coupling can be considered trustworthy.},

Determining the logic of these macrocircuits is necessary for understanding high level brain function. Here in mice, we have mapped the areal and laminar organization of the ipsi- and contralateral cortical projection onto the primary visual, somatosensory, and motor cortices. We find that although the ipsilateral hemisphere is the primary source of cortical input, there is substantial contralateral symmetry regarding the relative contribution and areal identity of input. Laminar analysis of these input areas show that excitatory Layer 6 corticocortical cells (L6 CCs) are a major projection pathway within and between the two hemispheres. Analysis of the relative contribution of inputs from supra- (feedforward) and infragranular (feedback) layers reveals that contra-hemispheric projections reflect a dominant feedback organization compared to their ipsi-cortical counterpart. The magnitude of the interhemispheric difference in hierarchy was largest for sensory and motor projection areas compared to frontal, medial, or lateral brain areas due to a proportional increase in input from L6 neurons. L6 CCs therefore not only mediate long-range cortical communication but also reflect its inherent feedback organization.},

  abstract         = {Summary Higher and lower cortical areas in the visual hierarchy are reciprocally connected [1]. Although much is known about how feedforward pathways shape receptive field properties of visual neurons, relatively little is known about the role of feedback pathways in visual processing. Feedback pathways are thought to carry top-down signals, including information about context (e.g., figure-ground segmentation and surround suppression) [2, 3, 4, 5], and feedback has been demonstrated to sharpen orientation tuning of neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) [6, 7]. However, the response characteristics of feedback neurons themselves and how feedback shapes V1 neurons’ tuning for other features, such as spatial frequency (SF), remain largely unknown. Here, using a retrograde virus, targeted electrophysiological recordings, and optogenetic manipulations, we show that putatively feedback neurons in layer 5 (hereafter “L5 feedback”) in higher visual areas, AL (anterolateral area) and PM (posteromedial area), display distinct visual properties in awake head-fixed mice. AL L5 feedback neurons prefer significantly lower SF (mean: 0.04 cycles per degree [cpd]) compared to PM L5 feedback neurons (0.15 cpd). Importantly, silencing AL L5 feedback reduced visual responses of V1 neurons preferring low SF (mean change in firing rate: −8.0%), whereas silencing PM L5 feedback suppressed responses of high-SF-preferring V1 neurons (−20.4%). These findings suggest that feedback connections from higher visual areas convey distinctly tuned visual inputs to V1 that serve to boost V1 neurons’ responses to SF. Such like-to-like functional organization may represent an important feature of feedback pathways in sensory systems and in the nervous system in general.},

Here we develop a visual spatial task for mice that elicits behavioural improvements consistent with the effects of spatial attention, and simultaneously measure network, cellular, and subthreshold activity in primary visual cortex. During trial-by-trial behavioural improvements, local field potential (LFP) responses to stimuli detected inside the receptive field (RF) strengthen. Moreover, detection inside the RF selectively enhances excitatory and inhibitory neuron responses to task-irrelevant stimuli and suppresses noise correlations and low frequency LFP fluctuations. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings reveal that detection inside the RF increases synaptic activity that depolarizes membrane potential responses at the behaviorally relevant location. Our study establishes that mice display fundamental signatures of visual spatial attention spanning behavioral, network, cellular, and synaptic levels, providing new insight into rapid cognitive enhancement of sensory signals in visual cortex.},

  abstract         = {Neural oscillatory activities have been shown to play important roles in neural information processing and the shaping of circuit connections during development. However, it remains unknown whether and how specific neural oscillations emerge during a postnatal critical period (CP), in which neuronal connections are most substantially modified by neural activity and experience. By recording local field potentials (LFPs) and single unit activity in developing primary visual cortex (V1) of head-fixed awake mice, we here demonstrate an emergence of characteristic oscillatory activities during the CP. From the pre-CP to CP, the peak frequency of spontaneous fast oscillatory activities shifts from the beta band (15-35 Hz) to the gamma band (40-70 Hz), accompanied by a decrease of cross-frequency coupling (CFC) and broadband spike-field coherence (SFC). Moreover, visual stimulation induced a large increase of beta-band activity but a reduction of gamma-band activity specifically from the CP onwards. Dark rearing of animals from the birth delayed this emergence of oscillatory activities during the CP, suggesting its dependence on early visual experience. These findings suggest that the characteristic neuronal oscillatory activities emerged specifically during the CP may represent as neural activity trait markers for the experience-dependent maturation of developing visual cortical circuits.},

  abstract         = {Summary Visual experience gives rise to persistent theta oscillations in the mouse primary visual cortex (V1) that are specific to the familiar stimulus. Our recent work demonstrated the presence of these oscillations in higher visual areas (HVAs), where they are synchronized with V1 in a context-dependent manner. However, it remains unclear where these unique oscillatory dynamics originate. To investigate this, we conducted paired extracellular electrophysiological recordings in two visual thalamic nuclei (dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus [dLGN] and lateral posterior nucleus [LP]), the retrosplenial cortex (RSC), and the hippocampus (HPC). Oscillatory activity was not found in either of the thalamic nuclei, but a sparse ensemble of oscillating neurons was observed in both the RSC and HPC, similar to V1. To infer functional connectivity changes between the brain regions, we performed directed information analysis, which indicated a trend toward decreased connectivity in all V1-paired regions, with a consistent increase in V1 → V1 connections, suggesting that the oscillations appear to initiate independently within V1. Lastly, complete NMDA lesioning of the HPC did not abolish theta oscillations in V1 that emerge with familiarity. Altogether, these results suggest that (1) theta oscillations do not originate in the thalamus; (2) RSC exhibits theta oscillations, which may follow V1 given the temporal delay present; and (3) the HPC had a sparse group of neurons, with theta oscillations matching V1; however, lesioning suggests that these oscillations emerge independent of each other. Overall, our findings pave the way for future studies to determine the mechanisms by which diverse inputs and outputs shape this memory-related oscillatory activity in the brain.},

  abstract         = {Laminar electrode arrays allow simultaneous recording of activity of many cortical neurons and assignment to layers using current source density (CSD) analyses. Electrode arrays with 100-micron contact spacing have been used to estimate borders between layer 4 versus superficial or deep layers, but in macaque primary visual cortex (V1) there are far more layers, such as 4A which is only 50-100 microns thick. Neuropixels electrode arrays have 20-micron spacing, and thus could potentially discern thinner layers and more precisely identify laminar borders. Here we show that laminar distributions of CSDs lack consistency and the spatial resolution required for thin layers and accurate layer boundaries. To take full advantage of high density Neuropixels arrays, we have developed approaches based on higher resolution electrical signals and analyses, including spike waveforms and spatial spread, unit density, high-frequency action potential (AP) power spectrum, temporal power change, and coherence spectrum, that afford far higher resolution of laminar distinctions, including the ability to precisely detect the borders of even the thinnest layers of V1.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.All data necessary to support the paper{\textquoteright}s conclusions are present in the main text, supplemental information, or available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.

  abstract         = {In recent years, the advent of the so-called silicon probes has made it possible to homogeneously sample spikes and local field potentials (LFPs) from a regular grid of cortical recording sites. In principle, this allows inferring the laminar location of the sites based on the spatiotemporal pattern of LFPs recorded along the probe, as in the well-known current source-density (CSD) analysis. This approach, however, has several limitations, since it relies on visual identification of landmark features (i.e., current sinks and sources) by human operators, features that can be absent from the CSD pattern if the probe does not span the whole cortical thickness, thus making manual labeling harder. Furthermore, as with any manual annotation procedure, the typical CSD-based workflow for laminar identification of recording sites is affected by subjective judgment undermining the consistency and reproducibility of results. To overcome these limitations, we developed an alternative approach, based on finding the optimal match between the LFPs recorded along a probe in a given experiment and a template LFP profile that was computed using 18 recording sessions, in which the depth of the recording sites had been recovered through histology. We show that this method can achieve an accuracy of 79 µm in recovering the cortical depth of recording sites and a 76% accuracy in inferring their laminar location. As such, our approach provides an alternative to CSD that, being fully automated, is less prone to the idiosyncrasies of subjective judgment and works reliably also for recordings spanning a limited cortical stretch.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Knowing the depth and laminar location of the microelectrodes used to record neuronal activity from the cerebral cortex is crucial to properly interpret the recorded patterns of neuronal responses. Here, we present an innovative approach that allows inferring such properties with high accuracy and in an automated way (i.e., without the need of visual inspection and manual annotation) from the evoked response potentials elicited by sensory (e.g., visual) stimuli.},

  abstract         = {Background The mammalian brain expresses a wide range of state-dependent network oscillations which vary in frequency and spatial extension. Such rhythms can entrain multiple neurons into coherent patterns of activity, consistent with a role in behaviour, cognition and memory formation. Recent evidence suggests that locally generated fast network oscillations can be systematically aligned to long-range slow oscillations. It is likely that such cross-frequency coupling supports specific tasks including behavioural choice and working memory.   Principal Findings We analyzed temporal coupling between high-frequency oscillations and EEG theta activity (4-12 Hz) in recordings from mouse parietal neocortex. Theta was exclusively present during active wakefulness and REM-sleep. Fast oscillations occurred in two separate frequency bands: gamma (40-100 Hz) and fast gamma (120-160 Hz). Theta, gamma and fast gamma were more prominent during active wakefulness as compared to REM-sleep. Coupling between theta and the two types of fast oscillations, however, was more pronounced during REM-sleep. This state-dependent cross-frequency coupling was particularly strong for theta-fast gamma interaction which increased 9-fold during REM as compared to active wakefulness. Theta-gamma coupling increased only by 1.5-fold.   Significance State-dependent cross-frequency-coupling provides a new functional characteristic of REM-sleep and establishes a unique property of neocortical fast gamma oscillations. Interactions between defined patterns of slow and fast network oscillations may serve selective functions in sleep-dependent information processing.},

Two main hypotheses have been suggested for routing of information based on oscillations, namely communication through coherence and gating by inhibition. Here, we propose a framework unifying these two hypotheses that is based on recent empirical findings. We discuss a theory in which communication between two regions is established by phase synchronization of oscillations at lower frequencies (&amp;lt;25 Hz), which serve as temporal reference frame for information carried by high-frequency activity (&amp;gt;40 Hz). Our framework, consistent with numerous recent empirical findings, posits that cross-frequency interactions are essential for understanding how large-scale cognitive and perceptual networks operate.},

To address this issue, we studied CFC in local field potential oscillations recorded from the CA3 region of the dorsal hippocampus of rats as they learned to associate items with their spatial context. During the course of learning, the amplitude of the low gamma subband (30?60 Hz) became more strongly modulated by theta phase in CA3, and higher levels of theta?gamma modulation were maintained throughout overtraining sessions. Furthermore, the strength of theta?gamma coupling was directly correlated with the increase in performance accuracy during learning sessions.

For instance, sensory information encoded in early sensory areas is relayed to, and further processed by, higher cortical areas and then fed back. However, the way in which feedforward and feedback signaling interact with one another is incompletely understood. Here we investigate this question by leveraging simultaneous neuronal population recordings in early and midlevel visual areas (V1-V2 and V1-V4). Using a dimensionality reduction approach, we find that population interactions are feedforward-dominated shortly after stimulus onset and feedback-dominated during spontaneous activity. The population activity patterns most correlated across areas were distinct during feedforward- and feedback-dominated periods. These results suggest that feedforward and feedback signaling rely on separate “channels”, which allows feedback signals to not directly affect activity that is fed forward.},

  abstract         = {We introduce FdeSolver, an open-source Julia package designed to solve fractional-order differential equations efficiently. The available solutions are based on product-integration rules, predictor–corrector algorithms, and the Newton-Raphson method. The package covers solutions for one-dimensional equations with orders of positive real numbers. For higher-dimensional systems, it supports orders up to one. Incommensurate derivatives are allowed and defined in the Caputo sense. Here, we summarize the implementation for a representative class of problems and compare it with available alternatives in Julia and MATLAB. Moreover, FdeSolver leverages the power and flexibility of the Julia environment to offer enhanced computational performance, and our development emphasizes adherence to the best practices of open research software. To highlight its practical utility, we demonstrate its capability in simulating microbial community dynamics and modeling the spread of COVID-19. This latter application involves fitting the order of derivatives grounded on real-world epidemiological data. Overall, these results highlight the efficiency, reliability, and practicality of the FdeSolver Julia package.},

  abstract         = {A unified fast time-stepping method for both fractional integral and derivative operators is proposed. The fractional operator is decomposed into a local part with memory length $$\varDelta T$$and a history part, where the local part is approximated by the direct convolution method and the history part is approximated by a fast memory-saving method. The fast method has $$O(n_0+\sum _{\ell }^L{q}_{\alpha }(N_{\ell }))$$active memory and $$O(n_0n_T+ (n_T-n_0)\sum _{\ell }^L{q}_{\alpha }(N_{\ell }))$$operations, where $$L=\log (n_T-n_0)$$, $$n_0={\varDelta T}/\tau ,n_T=T/\tau $$, $$\tau $$is the stepsize, T is the final time, and $${q}_{\alpha }{(N_{\ell })}$$is the number of quadrature points used in the truncated Laguerre-Gauss (LG) quadrature. The error bound of the present fast method is analyzed. It is shown that the error from the truncated LG quadrature is independent of the stepsize, and can be made arbitrarily small by choosing suitable parameters that are given explicitly. Numerical examples are presented to verify the effectiveness of the current fast method.},

Namely, (i) the linear fractional stable motion (LFSM) process and (ii) the fractional autoregressive moving average (FARIMA) time series with SαS innovations. These two types of heavy-tailed processes have infinite variances and long-range dependence and they can be used in modeling the traffic of modern computer telecommunication networks. We generate paths of the LFSM process by using Riemann-sum approximations of its SαS stochastic integral representation and paths of the FARIMA time series by truncating their moving average representation. In both the LFSM and FARIMA cases, we compute the involved sums efficiently by using the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm and provide bounds and/or estimates of the approximation error. We discuss different choices of the discretization and truncation parameters involved in our algorithms and illustrate our method. We include MATLAB implementations of these simulation algorithms and indicate how the practitioner can use them.},

To investigate this issue quantitatively, we need a tool to measure the difference between them and obviously this task is accomplished by the aid of an appropriate norm on a certain space of functions. For example, Sobolev spaces are indispensable part of theoretical analysis of partial differential equations and boundary integral equations, as well as are necessary for the analysis of some numerical methods for the solving of such equations. But most of articles that appear in this field usually use ‖.‖∞ in the space of C[a, b] which is very restrictive. In this paper, we introduce a new norm that is convenient for the fractional and singular differential equations. Using this norm, the existence and uniqueness of initial value problems for nonlinear Langevin equation with two different fractional orders are studied. In fact, the obtained results could be used for the classical cases. Finally, by two examples we show that we cannot always speak about the existence and uniqueness of solutions just by using the previous methods.},

  abstract     = {Accurate population models are needed to build very large-scale neural models, but their derivation is difficult for realistic networks of neurons, in particular when nonlinear properties are involved, such as conductance-based interactions and spike-frequency adaptation. Here, we consider such models based on networks of adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Using a master equation formalism, we derive a mean-field model of such networks and compare it to the full network dynamics. The mean-field model is capable of correctly predicting the average spontaneous activity levels in asynchronous irregular regimes similar to in vivo activity. It also captures the transient temporal response of the network to complex external inputs. Finally, the mean-field model is also able to quantitatively describe regimes where high- and low-activity states alternate (up-down state dynamics), leading to slow oscillations. We conclude that such mean-field models are biologically realistic in the sense that they can capture both spontaneous and evoked activity, and they naturally appear as candidates to build very large-scale models involving multiple brain areas.},

  abstract         = {When the local field potential of a cortical network displays coherent fast oscillations (∼40-Hz gamma or ∼200-Hz sharp-wave ripples), the spike trains of constituent neurons are typically irregular and sparse. The dichotomy between rhythmic local field and stochastic spike trains presents a challenge to the theory of brain rhythms in the framework of coupled oscillators. Previous studies have shown that when noise is large and recurrent inhibition is strong, a coherent network rhythm can be generated while single neurons fire intermittently at low rates compared to the frequency of the oscillation. However, these studies used too simplified synaptic kinetics to allow quantitative predictions of the population rhythmic frequency. Here we show how to derive quantitatively the coherent oscillation frequency for a randomly connected network of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with realistic synaptic parameters. In a noise-dominated interneuronal network, the oscillation frequency depends much more on the shortest synaptic time constants (delay and rise time) than on the longer synaptic decay time, and ∼200-Hz frequency can be realized with synaptic time constants taken from slice data. In a network composed of both interneurons and excitatory cells, the rhythmogenesis is a compromise between two scenarios: the fast purely interneuronal mechanism, and the slower feedback mechanism (relying on the excitatory-inhibitory loop). The properties of the rhythm are determined essentially by the ratio of time scales of excitatory and inhibitory currents and by the balance between the mean recurrent excitation and inhibition. Faster excitation than inhibition, or a higher excitation/inhibition ratio, favors the feedback loop and a much slower oscillation (typically in the gamma range).},

The validity of our approach is tested on a conductance based neuronal model showing WLC and through the extraction of Lévy flights inducing fractals from recordings of rat hippocampus during open field foraging. Further insights are gained analyzing mice motor cortex neurons and non motor cell signals. The proposed mechanism provides a plausible explanation for the neuro-dynamical fundamentals of spatial searching patterns observed in animals (including humans) and illustrates an until now unknown way to encode information in neuronal temporal series.},

However, not all heavy tails are the same. We provide canonical examples of different heavy-tailed distributions in cortical oscillations and discuss the corresponding mechanisms that each suggest, ranging from criticality to multistability, memory, bifurcations, and multiplicative noise. Their existence suggests that the brain is a strongly correlated complex system that employs many different functional mechanisms, and that likewise, we as scientists should refrain from methodological monism.},

  abstract         = {The human brain spontaneously generates neural oscillations with a large variability in frequency, amplitude, duration, and recurrence. Little, however, is known about the long-term spatiotemporal structure of the complex patterns of ongoing activity. A central unresolved issue is whether fluctuations in oscillatory activity reflect a memory of the dynamics of the system for more than a few seconds.We investigated the temporal correlations of network oscillations in the normal human brain at time scales ranging from a few seconds to several minutes. Ongoing activity during eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions was recorded with simultaneous magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography. Here we show that amplitude fluctuations of 10 and 20 Hz oscillations are correlated over thousands of oscillation cycles. Our analyses also indicated that these amplitude fluctuations obey power-law scaling behavior. The scaling exponents were highly invariant across subjects. We propose that the large variability, the long-range correlations, and the power-law scaling behavior of spontaneous oscillations find a unifying explanation within the theory of self-organized criticality, which offers a general mechanism for the emergence of correlations and complex dynamics in stochastic multiunit systems. The demonstrated scaling laws pose novel quantitative constraints on computational models of network oscillations. We argue that critical-state dynamics of spontaneous oscillations may lend neural networks capable of quick reorganization during processing demands.},

  abstract         = {Scale-free fluctuations are ubiquitous in behavioral performance and neuronal activity. In time scales from seconds to hundreds of seconds, psychophysical dynamics and the amplitude fluctuations of neuronal oscillations are governed by power-law-form long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs). In millisecond time scales, neuronal activity comprises cascade-like neuronal avalanches that exhibit power-law size and lifetime distributions. However, it remains unknown whether these neuronal scaling laws are correlated with those characterizing behavioral performance or whether neuronal LRTCs and avalanches are related. Here, we show that the neuronal scaling laws are strongly correlated both with each other and with behavioral scaling laws. We used source reconstructed magneto- and electroencephalographic recordings to characterize the dynamics of ongoing cortical activity. We found robust power-law scaling in neuronal LRTCs and avalanches in resting-state data and during the performance of audiovisual threshold stimulus detection tasks. The LRTC scaling exponents of the behavioral performance fluctuations were correlated with those of concurrent neuronal avalanches and LRTCs in anatomically identified brain systems. The behavioral exponents also were correlated with neuronal scaling laws derived from a resting-state condition and with a similar anatomical topography. Finally, despite the difference in time scales, the scaling exponents of neuronal LRTCs and avalanches were strongly correlated during both rest and task performance. Thus, long and short time-scale neuronal dynamics are related and functionally significant at the behavioral level. These data suggest that the temporal structures of human cognitive fluctuations and behavioral variability stem from the scaling laws of individual and intrinsic brain dynamics.},

Here, we investigate the effects of the noise filtering by synapses with various levels of realism on integrate-and-fire neuron dynamics. The noise input is modeled by white (for instantaneous synapses) or colored (for synapses with a finite relaxation time) noise. Analytical results for the modulation of firing probability in response to an oscillatory input current are obtained by expanding a Fokker-Planck equation for small parameters of the problem—when both the amplitude of the modulation is small compared to the background firing rate and the synaptic time constant is small compared to the membrane time constant. We report here the detailed calculations showing that if a synaptic decay time constant is included in the synaptic current model, the firing-rate modulation of the neuron due to an oscillatory input remains finite in the high-frequency limit with no phase lag. In addition, we characterize the low-frequency behavior and the behavior of the high-frequency limit for intermediate decay times. We also characterize the effects of introducing a rise time to the synaptic currents and the presence of several synaptic receptors with different kinetics. In both cases, we determine, using numerical simulations, an effective decay time constant that describes the neuronal response completely.},

  abstract         = {Networks of living neurons exhibit diverse patterns of activity, including oscillations, synchrony, and waves. Recent work in physics has shown yet another mode of activity in systems composed of many nonlinear units interacting locally. For example, avalanches, earthquakes, and forest fires all propagate in systems organized into a critical state in which event sizes show no characteristic scale and are described by power laws. We hypothesized that a similar mode of activity with complex emergent properties could exist in networks of cortical neurons. We investigated this issue in mature organotypic cultures and acute slices of rat cortex by recording spontaneous local field potentials continuously using a 60 channel multielectrode array. Here, we show that propagation of spontaneous activity in cortical networks is described by equations that govern avalanches. As predicted by theory for a critical branching process, the propagation obeys a power law with an exponent of -3/2 for event sizes, with a branching parameter close to the critical value of 1. Simulations show that a branching parameter at this value optimizes information transmission in feedforward networks, while preventing runaway network excitation. Our findings suggest that {\textquotedblleft}neuronal avalanches{\textquotedblright} may be a generic property of cortical networks, and represent a mode of activity that differs profoundly from oscillatory, synchronized, or wave-like network states. In the critical state, the network may satisfy the competing demands of information transmission and network stability.},

  abstract         = {Criticality has gained widespread interest in neuroscience as an attractive framework for understanding the character and functional implications of variability in brain activity. The metastability of critical systems maximizes their dynamic range, storage capacity, and computational power. Power-law scaling{\textemdash}a hallmark of criticality{\textemdash}has been observed on different levels, e.g., in the distribution of neuronal avalanches in vitro and in vivo, but also in the decay of temporal correlations in behavioral performance and ongoing oscillations in humans. An unresolved issue is whether power-law scaling on different organizational levels in the brain{\textemdash}and possibly in other hierarchically organized systems{\textemdash}can be related. Here, we show that critical-state dynamics of avalanches and oscillations jointly emerge in a neuronal network model when excitation and inhibition is balanced. The oscillatory activity of the model was qualitatively similar to what is typically observed in recordings of human resting-state MEG. We propose that homeostatic plasticity mechanisms tune this balance in healthy brain networks, and that it is essential for critical behavior on multiple levels of neuronal organization with ensuing functional benefits. Based on our network model, we introduce a concept of multi-level criticality in which power-law scaling can emerge on multiple time scales in oscillating networks.},

  abstract         = {Neuronal avalanches have become an ubiquitous tool to describe the activity of large neuronal assemblies. The emergence of scale-free statistics with well-defined exponents has led to the belief that the brain might operate near a critical point. Yet not much is known in terms of how the different exponents arise or how robust they are. Using calcium imaging recordings of dissociated neuronal cultures we show that the exponents are not universal, and that significantly different exponents arise with different culture preparations, leading to the existence of different universality classes. Naturally developing cultures show avalanche statistics consistent with those of a mean-field branching process, however, cultures grown in the presence of folic acid metabolites appear to be in a distinct universality class with significantly different critical exponents. Given the increased synaptic density and number of feedback loops in folate reared cultures, our results suggest that network topology plays a leading role in shaping the avalanche dynamics. We also show that for both types of cultures pronounced correlations exist in the sizes of neuronal avalanches indicating size clustering, being much stronger in folate reared cultures.},

  abstract         = {In self-organized critical (SOC) systems avalanche size distributions follow power-laws. Power-laws have also been observed for neural activity, and so it has been proposed that SOC underlies brain organization as well. Surprisingly, for spiking activity in vivo, evidence for SOC is still lacking. Therefore we analyzed highly parallel spike recordings from awake rats and monkeys, anaesthetized cats, and also local field potentials from humans. We compared these to spiking activity from two established critical models: the Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld model, and a stochastic branching model. We found fundamental differences between the neural and the model activity. These differences could be overcome for both models through a combination of three modifications: (1) subsampling, (2) increasing the input to the model (this way eliminating the separation of time scales, which is fundamental to SOC and its avalanche definition), and (3) making the model slightly sub-critical. The match between the neural activity and the modified models held not only for the classical avalanche size distributions and estimated branching parameters, but also for two novel measures (mean avalanche size, and frequency of single spikes), and for the dependence of all these measures on the temporal bin size.
Our results suggest that neural activity in vivo shows a mélange of avalanches, and not temporally separated ones, and that their global activity propagation can be approximated by the principle that one spike on average triggers a little less than one spike in the next step. This implies that neural activity does not reflect a SOC state but a slightly sub-critical regime without a separation of time scales. Potential advantages of this regime may be faster information processing, and a safety margin from super-criticality, which has been linked to epilepsy.},

In the hippocampus, theta oscillations (4–12 Hz) radiate as large-scale traveling waves, and serve as a scaffold for neuronal ensembles of multisensory information involved in memory and movement-related processing. An extension of such an encoding framework across the neocortex could similarly serve to bind disparate multisensory signals into ongoing, coherent, phase-coded processes. Whether the neocortex exhibits unique large-scale traveling waves distinct from that of the hippocampus, however, remains unknown. Here, using cortex-wide electrocorticography in freely moving mice, we find that theta oscillations are organized into bilaterally-symmetric spatiotemporal “modes” that span virtually the entire neocortex. The dominant mode (Mode 1) is a divergent traveling wave that originates from retrosplenial cortex and whose amplitude correlates with mouse speed. Secondary modes are asynchronous spiral waves centered over primary somatosensory cortex (Modes 2 and 3), which become prominent during rapid drops in amplitude and synchrony (null spikes) and which underlie a phase reset of Mode 1. These structured cortex-wide traveling waves may provide a scaffold for large-scale phase-coding of information across the cortex.},

However, their spatial organization, anatomical basis, and whether they are locally confined versus distributed across the brain, remains unclear. Here we used cortex-wide imaging and large-scale electrophysiology in awake mice to reveal the organization of traveling waves across spatial scales. Traveling waves formed spiral patterns predominantly centered on somatosensory cortex, sweeping across somatotopic maps. Strikingly, the local axonal architecture of neurons in sensory cortex exhibited a matching circular arrangement. At the cortex-wide scale, these spiral waves were mirrored between hemispheres and between sensory and motor cortex, reflecting topographic long-range axons. At the brain-wide scale, cortical spiral waves were coordinated with subcortical spiking patterns in the thalamus, striatum, and midbrain. These results establish that traveling waves are shaped by axonal pathways into coordinated spiral patterns that globally impact neural activity across diverse brain systems, revealing a distributed, multi-sensory organizational principle for propagating neural activity.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

We establish the existence of strong solutions for such equations and discuss the ergodicity and convergence to Gibbs measure. In the linear forcing regime, we show rigorously the algebraic convergence to Gibbs measure when the ‘fluctuation-dissipation theorem’ is satisfied, and this verifies that satisfying ‘fluctuation-dissipation theorem’ indeed leads to the correct physical behavior. We further discuss possible approaches to analyze the ergodicity and convergence to Gibbs measure in the nonlinear forcing regime, while leave the rigorous analysis for future works.

Presented here is a computationally intensive reconstruction of the ultrastructure of a cubic millimeter of human temporal cortex that was surgically removed to gain access to an underlying epileptic focus. It contains about 57,000 cells, about 230 millimeters of blood vessels, and about 150 million synapses and comprises 1.4 petabytes. Our analysis showed that glia outnumber neurons 2:1, oligodendrocytes were the most common cell, deep layer excitatory neurons could be classified on the basis of dendritic orientation, and among thousands of weak connections to each neuron, there exist rare powerful axonal inputs of up to 50 synapses. Further studies using this resource may bring valuable insights into the mysteries of the human brain. A complete understanding of the human brain begins with elucidation of its structural properties at a subcellular level. To provide a valuable resource for the scientific community and to better understand the structure of the human temporal cortex, Shapson-Coe et al. performed an electron microscopy reconstruction of a cubic millimeter of human temporal cortex.

In primates, higher visual areas are classified into two parts, the dorsal stream (“where” pathway) and ventral stream (“what” pathway). The ventral stream is known to include a part of the temporal cortex. In mice, however, some cortical areas adjacent to the primary visual area (V1) in the occipital cortex are thought to be comparable to the ventral stream in primates, although the whole picture of the mouse ventral stream has never been elucidated. We performed wide-field Ca2+ imaging in awake mice to investigate visual responses in the mouse temporal cortex, and found that the postrhinal cortex (POR), posterior to the auditory cortex (AC), and the ectorhinal and temporal association cortices (ECT), ventral to the AC, showed clear visual responses to moving visual objects. The retinotopic maps in the POR and ECT were not clearly observed, and the amplitudes of the visual responses in the POR and ECT were less sensitive to the size of the objects, compared to visual responses in the V1. In the ECT, objects of different sizes activated different subareas. These findings strongly suggest that the mouse ventral stream extends to the ECT ventral to the AC, and that it has characteristic response properties that are markedly different from the response properties in the V1.},

We have used cytoarchitectonic and chemoarchitectonic markers, topographic mapping of receptive fields, and pathway tracing to determine in mouse visual cortex whether the lateromedial field (LM) and the anterolateral field (AL), which are the principal targets of primary visual cortex (V1) (Wang and Burkhalter, 2007) specialized for processing nonspatial and spatial visual information (Gao et al., 2006), are distinct areas with diverse connections. We have found that the LM/AL border coincides with a change in type 2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor expression in layer 4 and with the representation of the lower visual field periphery. Our quantitative analyses also show that LM strongly projects to temporal cortex as well as the lateral entorhinal cortex, which has weak spatial selectivity (Hargreaves et al., 2005). In contrast, AL has stronger connections with posterior parietal cortex, motor cortex, and the spatially selective medial entorhinal cortex (Haftig et al., 2005). These results support the notion that LM and AL are architecturally, topographically, and connectionally distinct areas of extrastriate visual cortex and that they are gateways for ventral and dorsal streams.},

These include olfactory processing and representation in the fruitfly antennal lobe, the encoding of value in the posterior parietal cortex, multisensory integration of visual motion and vestibular signals, and auditory processing in the primary auditory cortex.Different (feedforward and feedback) neural circuits and mechanisms might perform normalization, including presynaptic inhibition, shunting inhibition, synaptic depression, changes in the amplitude of ongoing activity and balanced amplification.The effects of normalization can be measured behaviourally.The computational benefits of normalization include maximizing sensitivity, providing invariance with respect to some stimulus dimensions at the expense of others, facilitating the decoding of a distributed neural representation, facilitating the discrimination among representations of different stimuli, providing max-pooling (winner-take-all competition) and reducing redundancy.Understanding canonical neural computations such as normalization may shed light on psychiatric, neurological and developmental disorders.},

This dramatic transformation suggests that there are specific rules governing the connections made between thalamic and cortical neurons1-3 (see ref. 4). Here we report a study of these rules in which we recorded from thalamic (lateral geniculate nucleus; LGN) and cortical neurons simultaneously and related their receptive fields to their connectivity, as measured by cross-correlation analysis5,6. The probability of finding a monosynaptic connection was high when a geniculate receptive field was superimposed anywhere over an elongated simple-cell subregion of the same signature (on or off). However, 'inappropriate' connections from geniculate cells of the opposite receptive field signature were extremely rare. Together, these findings imply that the outline of the elongated, simple receptive field, and thus of cortical orientation selectivity, is laid down at the level of the first synapse from the thalamic afferents.},

This thin, layered structure comprises distinct, functionally specialized areas that communicate with each other through the axons of pyramidal neurons. For the hundreds of such cortico-cortical pathways to underlie diverse functions, their cellular and synaptic architectures must differ so that they result in distinct computations at the target projection neurons. In what ways do these pathways differ? By originating and terminating in different laminae, and by selectively targeting specific populations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, these ‘interareal’ pathways can differentially control the timing and strength of synaptic inputs onto individual neurons, resulting in layer-specific computations. Due to the rapid development in transgenic techniques, the mouse has emerged as a powerful mammalian model for understanding the rules by which cortical circuits organize and function. Here we review our understanding of how cortical lamination constrains long-range communication in the mammalian brain, with an emphasis on the mouse visual cortical network. We discuss the laminar architecture underlying interareal communication, the role of neocortical layers in organizing the balance of excitatory and inhibitory actions, and highlight the structure and function of layer 1 in mouse visual cortex.},

Layer 1 (L1) is an important part of the underlying network. This cell-sparse layer is a target of feedback and local inputs, and nexus for contacts onto apical dendrites of projection neurons in the layers below. Importantly, L1 is a site for coupling inputs from the outside world with internal information. To determine whether all of these circuit elements overlap in L1, we labeled the horizontal network within mouse V1 with anterograde and retrograde viral tracers. We found two types of local horizontal connections: short ones that were tangentially limited to the representation of the point image, and long ones which reached beyond the receptive field center deep into its surround. The long connections were patchy and terminated preferentially in M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor-negative (M2-) interpatches. Anterogradely labeled inputs overlapped in M2-interpatches with apical dendrites of retrogradely labeled L2/3 and L5 cells, forming module-selective loops between topographically distant locations. Previous work showed that L1 of M2-interpatches receive inputs from the lateral posterior thalamic nucleus (LP) (D'Souza et al., 2019) and from a feedback network from areas of the medial dorsal stream, including the secondary motor cortex (Meier et al., 2024). Together these findings suggest that interactions in M2-interpatches play a role in processing visual inputs produced by object-and self-motion.},

Here, we summarize these findings, compare them with the rich literature of SC studies in other species, and highlight important gaps and exciting future directions.

Moreover, we found that information about the visual target to be reached was encoded in terms of both latency and amplitude of evoked waves at a time when the field phase-locked with respect to the target onset. These findings suggest that high-frequency oscillations may subserve intra- and inter-cortical information transfer during movement preparation and execution.},

We show that TWs are robust in microarray recordings in frontal and parietal cortex and encode recent reward history. Two adult male monkeys made saccades to obtain probabilistic rewards and were sensitive to the (statistically irrelevant) reward on the previous trial. TWs in frontal and parietal areas were stronger in trials that followed a prior reward versus a lack of reward and, in the frontal lobe, correlated with the monkeys’ behavioral sensitivity to the prior reward. The findings suggest that neural communication mediated by TWs within the frontal and parietal lobes contribute to maintaining information about recent reward history and mediating the impact of this history on the monkeys’ expectations.},

First, we confirm that each stimulus can be decoded from brain activity for \~{}1s, and we demonstrate that the brain simultaneously represents multiple images at each time instant. Second, we source localize the corresponding brain responses in the expected visual hierarchy and show that distinct brain regions represent, at each time instant, different snapshots of past stimulations. Third, we propose a simple framework to further characterize the dynamical system of these traveling waves. Our results show that a chain of neural circuits, which each consist of (1) a hidden maintenance mechanism and (2) an observable update mechanism, accounts for the dynamics of macroscopic brain representations elicited by visual sequences. Together, these results detail a simple architecture explaining how successive visual events and their respective timings can be simultaneously represented in the brain.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Our retinas are continuously bombarded with a rich flux of visual input. Yet, how our brain continuously processes such visual streams is a major challenge to neuroscience. Here, we developed techniques to decode and track, from human brain activity, multiple images flashed in rapid succession. Our results show that the brain simultaneously represents multiple successive images at each time instant by multiplexing them along a neural cascade. Dynamical modeling shows that these results can be explained by a hierarchy of neural assemblies that continuously propagate multiple visual contents. Overall, this study sheds new light on the biological basis of our visual experience.},

  abstract         = {Self-organized criticality (SOC) and stochastic oscillations (SOs) are two theoretically contradictory phenomena that are suggested to coexist in the brain. Recently it has been shown that an accumulation-release process like sandpile dynamics can generate SOC and SOs simultaneously. We considered the effect of the network structure on this coexistence and showed that the sandpile dynamics on a small-world network can produce two power law regimes along with two groups of SOs—two peaks in the power spectrum of the generated signal simultaneously. We also showed that external stimuli in the sandpile dynamics do not affect the coexistence of SOC and SOs but increase the frequency of SOs, which is consistent with our knowledge of the brain.},
