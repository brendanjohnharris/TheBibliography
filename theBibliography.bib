We also consider the case when two Rössler systems are unidirectionally coupled and when a Lorenz system is driven by a Rössler system.

For low feedback levels, we derive a third-order delay-differential equation for the phase of the laser field. We then show analytically and numerically that this equation admits coexisting branches of stable periodic solutions that appear at different and almost constant amplitudes. These amplitudes are proportional to the roots of the Bessel function J1(x). The bifurcation diagram of the phase equation is in good agreement with the numerical bifurcation diagram of the original Lang and Kobayashi equations. We interpret the onset of the periodic solutions as the emergence of a new set of external cavity modes with a more complicated time dependence. © 1996 The American Physical Society.},

How is it that groups of neurons dispersed through the brain interact to generate complex behaviors? Three papers in this issue present brain-scale studies of neuronal activity and dynamics (see the Perspective by Huk and Hart). Allen et al. found that in thirsty mice, there is widespread neural activity related to stimuli that elicit licking and drinking. Individual neurons encoded task-specific responses, but every brain area contained neurons with different types of response. Optogenetic stimulation of thirst-sensing neurons in one area of the brain reinstated drinking and neuronal activity across the brain that previously signaled thirst. Gründemann et al. investigated the activity of mouse basal amygdala neurons in relation to behavior during different tasks. Two ensembles of neurons showed orthogonal activity during exploratory and nonexploratory behaviors, possibly reflecting different levels of anxiety experienced in these areas. Stringer et al. analyzed spontaneous neuronal firing, finding that neurons in the primary visual cortex encoded both visual information and motor activity related to facial movements. The variability of neuronal responses to visual stimuli in the primary visual area is mainly related to arousal and reflects the encoding of latent behavioral states.

Structured Abstract
INTRODUCTIONIn the absence of sensory inputs, the brain produces structured patterns of activity, which can be as large as or larger than sensory-driven activity. Ongoing activity exists even in primary sensory cortices and has been hypothesized to reflect recapitulation of previous sensory experiences, or expectations of possible sensory events. Alternatively, ongoing activity could be related to behavioral and cognitive states.
RATIONALEMuch previous work has linked spontaneous neural activity to behavior through one-dimensional measures like running speed and pupil diameter. However, mice perform diverse behaviors consisting of whisking, licking, sniffing, and other facial movements. We hypothesized that there exists a multidimensional representation of behavior in visual cortex and that previously reported “noise” during stimulus presentations may in fact be behaviorally driven. To investigate this, we recorded the activity of {\textasciitilde}10,000 neurons in visual cortex of awake mice using two-photon calcium imaging, while simultaneously monitoring the facial movements using an infrared camera. In a second set of experiments, we recorded the activity of thousands of neurons across the brain using eight simultaneous Neuropixels probes, again videographically monitoring facial behavior.
RESULTSFirst, we found that ongoing activity in visual cortex is high dimensional: More than a hundred latent dimensions could be reliably extracted from the population activity. We found that a third of this activity could be predicted by a multidimensional model of the mouse’s behavior, extracted from the face video. This behaviorally related activity was not limited to visual cortex. We observed multidimensional representations of behavior in electrophysiological recordings from frontal, sensorimotor, and retrosplenial cortex; hippocampus; striatum; thalamus; and midbrain. Even though both behavior and neural activity contained fast–time scale fluctuations on the order of 200 ms, they were only related to each other at a time scale of about 1 s. We next investigated how this spontaneous, behavior-related signal interacts with stimulus responses. The representation of sensory stimuli and behavioral variables was mixed in the same neurons: The fractions of each neuron’s variance explained by stimuli and by behavior were only slightly negatively correlated, and neurons with similar stimulus responses did not have more similar behavioral correlates. Nevertheless, at a population level, the neural dimensions encoding motor variables overlapped with those encoding visual stimuli along only one dimension, which coherently increased or decreased the activity of the entire population. Activity in all other behaviorally driven dimensions continued unperturbed regardless of sensory stimulation.
CONCLUSIONThe brainwide representation of behavioral variables suggests that information encoded nearly anywhere in the forebrain is combined with behavioral state variables into a mixed representation. We found that these multidimensional signals are present both during ongoing activity and during passive viewing of a stimulus. This suggests that previously reported noise during stimulus presentations may consist primarily of behavioral-state information. What benefit could this ubiquitous mixing of sensory and motor information provide? The most appropriate behavior for an animal to perform at any moment depends on the combination of available sensory data, ongoing motor actions, and purely internal variables such as motivational drives. Integration of sensory inputs with motor actions must therefore occur somewhere in the nervous system. Our data indicate that it happens as early as primary sensory cortex. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/364/6437/eaav7893/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Large-scale neural population recordings can be predicted from behavior.We used new recording technologies to simultaneously monitor the activity of {\textasciitilde}10,000 neurons in a single brain area and {\textasciitilde}3000 neurons from across the brain (top left). These neurons showed slow–time scale patterns of coactivation restricted to subsets of neurons which were distributed across the brain (top right). The patterns of neural activity appeared to be driven by specific spontaneous behaviors that the animals engaged in during the experiment. We tracked these spontaneous behaviors by projecting a video recording of the mouse face onto a set of canonical “eigenfaces” (bottom left) and used these projections to predict a large fraction of the neural activity (bottom right). t, time; PC, principal component.
Neuronal populations in sensory cortex produce variable responses to sensory stimuli and exhibit intricate spontaneous activity even without external sensory input. Cortical variability and spontaneous activity have been variously proposed to represent random noise, recall of prior experience, or encoding of ongoing behavioral and cognitive variables. Recording more than 10,000 neurons in mouse visual cortex, we observed that spontaneous activity reliably encoded a high-dimensional latent state, which was partially related to the mouse’s ongoing behavior and was represented not just in visual cortex but also across the forebrain. Sensory inputs did not interrupt this ongoing signal but added onto it a representation of external stimuli in orthogonal dimensions. Thus, visual cortical population activity, despite its apparently noisy structure, reliably encodes an orthogonal fusion of sensory and multidimensional behavioral information.
Neurons in the primary visual cortex encode both visual information and motor activity.

  abstract = {Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is estimated to be present in 50% of people living with diabetes mellitus (DM). Comorbidities of DM, such as macrovascular and microvascular changes, also interact with DPN and affect its course. In patients with DM, DPN is the leading cause of foot ulcers, which in turn are a major cause of amputation in the United States. Although most patients with DPN do not have pain, approximately 11% of patients with DPN have chronic, painful symptoms that diminish quality of life, disrupt sleep, and can lead to depression. Despite the number of patients affected by DPN pain, little consensus exists about the pathophysiology, best diagnostic tools, and primary treatment choices. This article reviews the current knowledge about and presents recommendations for diagnostic assessment of DPN pain based on a review of the literature.},

  abstract  = {Neuropathic pain remains underrecognised and ineffectively treated in chronic pain sufferers. Consequently, their quality of life is considerably reduced, and substantial healthcare costs are incurred. The anatomical location of pain must be identified for definitive diagnosis, but current neuropsychological tools cannot do so. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) are thought to maintain peripheral neuroinflammation, and MMP-12 is elevated particularly in such pathological conditions. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the peripheral nervous system has made headway, owing to its high-contrast resolution and multiplanar features. We sought to improve MRI specificity of neural lesions, by constructing an MMP-12-targeted magnetic iron oxide nanoparticle (IONP). Its <italic>in vivo</italic> efficiency was evaluated in a rodent model of neuropathic pain, where the left lumbar 5 (L5) spinal nerve was tightly ligated. Spinal nerve ligation (SNL) successfully induced mechanical allodynia, and thermal hyperalgesia, in the left hind paw throughout the study duration. These neuropathy characteristics were absent in animals that underwent sham surgery. MMP-12 upregulation with concomitant macrophage infiltration, demyelination, and elastin fibre loss was observed at the site of ligation. This was not observed in spinal nerves contralateral and ipsilateral to the ligated spinal nerve or uninjured left L5 spinal nerves. The synthesised MMP-12-targeted magnetic IONP was stable and nontoxic <italic>in vitro</italic>. It was administered onto the left L5 spinal nerve by intrathecal injection, and decreased magnetic resonance (MR) signal was observed at the site of ligation. Histology analysis confirmed the presence of iron in ligated spinal nerves, whereas iron was not detected in uninjured left L5 spinal nerves. Therefore, MMP-12 is a potential biomarker of neuropathic pain. Its detection <italic>in vivo</italic>, using IONP-enhanced MRI, may be further developed as a tool for neuropathic pain diagnosis and management.},

  abstract = {Summary Central post-stroke pain (CPSP) is a neuropathic pain syndrome characterized by constant or intermittent pain in a body part occurring after stroke and associated with sensory abnormalities in the painful body part. This study describes CPSP prospectively during the first year after stroke and characterizes the cerebrovascular lesions and neurological signs associated with the CPSP syndrome. Two hundred and sixty-seven consecutively admitted patients younger than 81 years were examined in the first week, at 1, 6 and 12 months after stroke. Sensibility to touch (cotton wool), temperature (20°C and 40°C), and pinprick was studied using the contralateral face and extremity as control. A CT scan was done 8 (median) days (range: 1-34 days) after stroke. Two hundred and seven (78%) patients surviving at least 6 months who were able to communicate reliably formed the basis of the study. Abnormal sensory signs were found at least once in 87 (42%) patients. CPSP was found in 16 (8%) patients of whom all but 1 patient also had evoked dysesthesia or allodynia. Further 1 patient had persistent evoked dysesthesia but denied pain. CPSP was not related to sex or age. In patients with single acute cerebral lesions there were no relation between size or location of the lesions and the presence of CPSP. The pain was light in 6 (3%) patients and moderate to severe in 10 (5%) patients. The pain quality was usually lacerating or aching. Fifteen (94%) patients had decreased temperature, touch and pain sensibility and 9 (56%) reported allodynia to cold stimulation and another 9 (56%) patients reported this to touch. Pain onset was within 1 month after stroke in 10 (63%) patients, between 1 and 6 months in 3 (19%) patients and more than 6 months after stroke in 3 (19%) patients. ∗Corresponding author: Dr. Grethe Andersen, Dept. of Neurology, Aalborg Hospital, P.O.

  abstract = {Mouse genetics has contributed significantly to our understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying tissue and nerve injury-induced persistent pain. To create a highly reproducible, relatively noninvasive model of neuropathic pain in the mouse, we examined the behavioral consequences of sparing each of the 3 distal branches of the sciatic nerve in wild-type mice after a model originally described in the rat. Sparing the tibial branch but sparing neither of the other branches produced robust mechanical allodynia while leaving heat sensibility intact. To assess the topographic organization of the IB4 population of afferents from each branch and to compare anatomic consistency across injury models, we examined loss of thiamine monophosphatase staining in the superficial dorsal horn after peripheral nerve injury. We found that each of the sciatic branches targets a distinct mediolateral location in inner lamina II and that each of the spared nerve injury models produced a more reproducible pattern of thiamine monophosphatase staining loss than did partial tight ligation. These results improve on previous nerve injury models in mouse, demonstrate similar behavioral changes as in rat, and provide novel information on the topographic organization of small diameter peripheral afferents in the mouse spinal cord.},

  abstract = {During the last decades, neuroscientists have increasingly exploited a variety of artificial, de-novo synthesized materials with controlled nano-sized features. For instance, a renewed interest in the development of prostheses or neural interfaces was driven by the availability of novel nanomaterials that enabled the fabrication of implantable bioelectronics interfaces with reduced side effects and increased integration with the target biological tissue. The peculiar physical-chemical properties of nanomaterials have also contributed to the engineering of novel imaging devices toward sophisticated experimental settings, to smart fabricated scaffolds and microelectrodes, or other tools ultimately aimed at a better understanding of neural tissue functions. In this review, we focus on nanomaterials and specifically on carbon-based nanomaterials, such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene. While these materials raise potential safety concerns, they represent a tremendous technological opportunity for the restoration of neuronal functions. We then describe nanotools such as nanowires and nano-modified MEA for high-performance electrophysiological recording and stimulation of neuronal electrical activity. We finally focus on the fabrication of three-dimensional synthetic nanostructures, used as substrates to interface biological cells and tissues in vitro and in vivo.},

CQDs can be prepared simply and inexpensively by multiple techniques, such as the arc-discharge method, microwave pyrolysis, hydrothermal method, and electrochemical synthesis. CQDs show excellent physical and chemical properties like high crystallization, good dispersibility, photoluminescence properties. In particular, the small size, superconductivity, and rapid electron transfer of CQDs endow the CQDs-based composite with improved electric conductivity and catalytic activity. Besides, CQDs have abundant functional groups on the surface which could facilitate the preparation of multi-component electrical active catalysts. The interactions inside these multi-component catalysts may further enhance the catalytic performance by promoting charge transfer which plays an important role in electrochemistry. Most recent researches on CQDs have focused on their fluorescence characteristics and photocatalytic properties. This review will summarize the primary advances of CQDs in the synthetic methods, excellent physical and electronic properties, and application in electrocatalysis, including oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reduction (HER), and CO<sub>2</sub> reduction reaction (CO<sub>2</sub>RR).},

To characterize single-layer graphene, interfacial diffraction-induced color difference was the first milestone in the graphene adventure, and then Raman spectroscopy, scanning probe microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy were used to identify the graphene layers. Apart from the Scotch tap legend, the massive production of graphene is important for graphene research and applications. The current preparation methods can be classified into top-down (eg, chemical intercalation and liquid exfoliation) and bottom-up (eg, chemical vapor deposition and, chemical total synthesis) strategies. The massive production of graphene has enabled researchers to explore graphene in a variety of applications, for instance, energy conversion and storage, sensor, reinforcement, catalysis, separation, and so on. Meanwhile, inspired by the legend of graphene, other layered materials are being investigated.

  abstract = {Nanocarbons can be characterized by their curvature—that is, positively curved fullerenes, zero-curved graphene, and negatively curved schwarzites. Schwartzites are fascinating materials but have not been synthesized yet, although disordered materials with local properties similar to schwarzites (“random schwarzites”) have been isolated. A promising synthetic method allows for the interior surfaces of zeolites to be templated with sp2 carbon, but theoretical study of these zeolite-templated carbons (ZTCs) has been limited because of their noncrystalline structures. In this work, we develop an improved molecular description of ZTCs, show that they are equivalent to schwartzites, and thus make the experimental discovery of schwarzites ex post facto. Our topological characterization of ZTCs lends insights into how template choice allows for the tunability of ordered microporous carbons.Zeolite-templated carbons (ZTCs) comprise a relatively recent material class synthesized via the chemical vapor deposition of a carbon-containing precursor on a zeolite template, followed by the removal of the template. We have developed a theoretical framework to generate a ZTC model from any given zeolite structure, which we show can successfully predict the structure of known ZTCs. We use our method to generate a library of ZTCs from all known zeolites, to establish criteria for which zeolites can produce experimentally accessible ZTCs, and to identify over 10 ZTCs that have never before been synthesized. We show that ZTCs partition space into two disjoint labyrinths that can be described by a pair of interpenetrating nets. Since such a pair of nets also describes a triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS), our results establish the relationship between ZTCs and schwarzites—carbon materials with negative Gaussian curvature that resemble TPMSs—linking the research topics and demonstrating that schwarzites should no longer be thought of as purely hypothetical materials.},

  abstract = {Prolonged exposure to an effective stimulus generally reduces the sensitivity of neurons early in the visual pathway. Yet eye and head movements bring about frequent changes in the retinal image, and it is less clear that exposure to brief presentations will produce similar desensitization. To address this, we made extracellular recordings from single neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus of anesthetized marmosets, a New World primate. We measured the contrast response for drifting gratings before and after 0.5-s exposure to a high-contrast drifting grating, a stationary grating, or a blank screen. Prior exposure to the drifting grating reduced the contrast sensitivity of cells in the magnocellular pathway, on average by 23%; this reduction remained strong when the adapting and test stimuli were separated by 0.4 s. Exposure to a stationary grating of the preferred spatial phase did not change the contrast response; exposure to the opposite spatial phase did. None of the brief adaptors reduced the sensitivity of parvocellular cells. We conclude that brief periods of high contrast, such as those that would be expected to occur during a normal visual fixation, are sufficient to reduce the sensitivity of magnocellular-pathway cells.},

In the mouse retina nearly 40 GC types have been recognized and a substantial fraction of these show direction selectivity (DS) (Sabbah et al., Nature 546:492, 2017). By contrast in the primate ~17 GC types have been identified and DS has not been reported (Crook et al., The New Vis. Neurosci. 2014; Masri, et al., J. Comp. Neurol. 2017). However, a single GC type, the recursive bistratified cell, shares morphological features with ON-OFF DS cells of non-primate mammals and has been proposed as a likely DSGC (Dacey, The Cog. Neurosci. 2004; Moritoh, et al., Plos One 8: e54667, 2013).    Rhodamine dextran was injected at physiologically identified locations in superior colliculus of macaque monkeys (Crook et al., J Neurosci 28:12654, 2008). After retrograde transport of dye photodynamic staining in the vitro retina (Dacey, Neuron 37:15, 2003) was used to visualize GCs and selectively target the recursive bistratified cell for extracellularly recording. Bars that varied in speed and size were moved across the receptive field in directions spanning 360 deg at 30 deg intervals. Directional tuning was characterized by the directions of motion that evoked the greatest (preferred) and smallest (null) spike discharge and a DS index given by the preferred and null response difference relative to the preferred response.    Unlike DSGCs in non-primate mammals where multiple populations show extensive dendritic overlap the recursive bistratified cells formed a single mosaic that tiled with little dendritic overlap comprising ~1.5% of the total GC population in the retinal periphery (Fig. top). Recursive cells show ON-OFF light responses and are strongly DS (Fig. bottom) with indexes ranging from 1.0 - 0.11 (mean +/- std = 0.46 +/- 0.18; n=23) and preferred directions that varied across cells.    In macaque monkey retina a single GC type, the recursive bistratified cell shows ON-OFF direction selectivity and is present as a single population that tiles the retina with little dendritic overlap. We hypothesize that the low density of DSGCs in primate may explain a lower total number of GC types relative to other mammals and that the variable direction preferences found thus far may be related to retinal position relative to the foveal specialization unique to primate.

Crauel and Flandoli       (J. Dynam. Differential Equations 10 (1998) 259-274) had shown earlier      that adding noise to a system with a deterministic pitchfork       bifurcation yields a unique attracting random equilibrium with       negative Lyapunov exponent throughout, thus "destroying" this       bifurcation. Indeed, we show that in this example the dynamics before       and after the underlying deterministic bifurcation point are       topologically equivalent. However, in apparent paradox to (J. Dynam.       Differential Equations 10 (1998) 259-274), we show that there is after      all a qualitative change in the random dynamics at the underlying       deterministic bifurcation point, characterized by the transition from       a hyperbolic to a non-hyperbolic dichotomy spectrum. This breakdown       manifests itself also in the loss of uniform attractivity, a loss of       experimental observability of the Lyapunov exponent, and a loss of       equivalence under uniformly continuous topological conjugacies.},

A detailed nonlinear dynamical model of a generator along with its excitation control and turbine governing system loop and motor loads have been considered. The hard limiters in the generator control loops have been modelled using a new approach in an analytic form and its load torque as nonlinear function of speed.

  abstract = {In the Earth's history, periods of relatively stable climate have often been interrupted by sharp transitions to a contrasting state. One explanation for such events of abrupt change is that they happened when the earth system reached a critical tipping point. However, this remains hard to prove for events in the remote past, and it is even more difficult to predict if and when we might reach a tipping point for abrupt climate change in the future. Here, we analyze eight ancient abrupt climate shifts and show that they were all preceded by a characteristic slowing down of the fluctuations starting well before the actual shift. Such slowing down, measured as increased autocorrelation, can be mathematically shown to be a hallmark of tipping points. Therefore, our results imply independent empirical evidence for the idea that past abrupt shifts were associated with the passing of critical thresholds. Because the mechanism causing slowing down is fundamentally inherent to tipping points, it follows that our way to detect slowing down might be used as a universal early warning signal for upcoming catastrophic change. Because tipping points in ecosystems and other complex systems are notoriously hard to predict in other ways, this is a promising perspective.},

  abstract = {The human brain has the capacity to rapidly change state, and in epilepsy these state changes can be catastrophic, resulting in loss of consciousness, injury and even death. Theoretical interpretations considering the brain as a dynamical system suggest that prior to a seizure, recorded brain signals may exhibit critical slowing down, a warning signal preceding many critical transitions in dynamical systems. Using long-term intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings from fourteen patients with focal epilepsy, we monitored key signatures of critical slowing down prior to seizures. The metrics used to detect critical slowing down fluctuated over temporally long scales (hours to days), longer than would be detectable in standard clinical evaluation settings. Seizure risk was associated with a combination of these signals together with epileptiform discharges. These results provide strong validation of theoretical models and demonstrate that critical slowing down is a reliable indicator that could be used in seizure forecasting algorithms.},

The next era of brain mapping will be driven by studies that consider both of these components of brain organization simultaneously--elucidating their interactions and dependencies. Using this guiding principle, we explored the origin of slowly fluctuating patterns of synchronization within the topological core of brain regions known as the rich club, implicated in the regulation of mood and introspection. We find that a constellation of densely interconnected regions that constitute the rich club (including the anterior insula, amygdala and precuneus) play a central role in promoting a stable, dynamical core of spontaneous activity in the primate cortex. The slow timescales are well matched to the regulation of internal visceral states, corresponding to the somatic correlates of mood and anxiety. In contrast, the topology of the surrounding 'feeder' cortical regions shows unstable, rapidly fluctuating dynamics likely to be crucial for fast perceptual processes. We discuss these findings in relation to psychiatric disorders and the future of connectomics.},

This observation is at the core of the so-called criticality hypothesis, which states that systems in a dynamical regime between order and disorder attain the highest level of computational capabilities and achieve an optimal trade-off between robustness and flexibility. Recent results in cellular and evolutionary biology, neuroscience and computer science have revitalised the interest in the criticality hypothesis, emphasising its role as a viable candidate general law in adaptive complex systems. This paper provides an overview of the works on dynamical criticality that are -- To the best of our knowledge -- Particularly relevant for the criticality hypothesis. The authors review the main contributions concerning dynamics and information processing at the edge of chaos, and illustrate the main achievements in the study of critical dynamics in biological systems. Finally, the authors discuss open questions and propose an agenda for future work.},

Preliminary analyses based on a finalized set of acquisition and preprocessing protocols demonstrate the exceptionally high quality of the data from each modality.

  abstract               = {The Human Connectome Project (HCP) faces the challenging task of bringing multiple magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) modalities together in a common automated preprocessing framework across a large cohort of subjects. The MRI data acquired by the HCP differ in many ways from data acquired on conventional 3 Tesla scanners and often require newly developed preprocessing methods. We describe the minimal preprocessing pipelines for structural, functional, and diffusion MRI that were developed by the HCP to accomplish many low level tasks, including spatial artifact/distortion removal, surface generation, cross-modal registration, and alignment to standard space. These pipelines are specially designed to capitalize on the high quality data offered by the HCP. The final standard space makes use of a recently introduced CIFTI file format and the associated grayordinate spatial coordinate system. This allows for combined cortical surface and subcortical volume analyses while reducing the storage and processing requirements for high spatial and temporal resolution data. Here, we provide the minimum image acquisition requirements for the HCP minimal preprocessing pipelines and additional advice for investigators interested in replicating the HCP's acquisition protocols or using these pipelines. Finally, we discuss some potential future improvements to the pipelines.},

  abstract = {In this study, we have assessed the validity and reliability of an automated labeling system that we have developed for subdividing the human cerebral cortex on magnetic resonance images into gyral based regions of interest (ROIs). Using a dataset of 40 MRI scans we manually identified 34 cortical ROIs in each of the individual hemispheres. This information was then encoded in the form of an atlas that was utilized to automatically label ROIs. To examine the validity, as well as the intra- and inter-rater reliability of the automated system, we used both intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), and a new method known as mean distance maps, to assess the degree of mismatch between the manual and the automated sets of ROIs. When compared with the manual ROIs, the automated ROIs were highly accurate, with an average ICC of 0.835 across all of the ROIs, and a mean distance error of less than 1 mm. Intra- and inter-rater comparisons yielded little to no difference between the sets of ROIs. These findings suggest that the automated method we have developed for subdividing the human cerebral cortex into standard gyral-based neuroanatomical regions is both anatomically valid and reliable. This method may be useful for both morphometric and functional studies of the cerebral cortex as well as for clinical investigations aimed at tracking the evolution of disease-induced changes over time, including clinical trials in which MRI-based measures are used to examine response to treatment.},

Recent studies indicate that people can predict motion onset before it occurs, raising the question of what informational cues underlie this ability. We use data from an antagonistic game between two participants, an Attacker and a Blocker wherein the Blocker is asked to parry the movements of the Attacker. We find that well before the Attacker starts to move, the fluctuations of the Attacker’s body about a static pose are accompanied by early warning signals akin to critical transitions in dynamical systems. These early warning signals allow for the anticipation of the Attacker’s impending motion before it occurs. Analysis of the early warning signals allows us to characterize the nature of the critical transition, and to simulate it in a simple dot motion experiment. When the dot motion simulations are shown to human participants, we find that they react faster if there is a coming critical transition relative to a transition devoid of the early warning signals. This suggests that people recognize and act upon early warning signals when inferring the onset of motion, and more generally in motor decision making processes.},

However, whether abnormalities at the cellular level can be diagnosed from network activity measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is largely unknown, yet of high clinical relevance. Here a putative mechanism reported in neurodevelopmental disorders, that is, excitation-to-inhibition ratio (E:I), was chemogenetically increased within cortical microcircuits of the mouse brain and measured via fMRI. Increased E:I caused a significant “reduction” of long-range connectivity, irrespective of whether excitatory neurons were facilitated or inhibitory Parvalbumin (PV) interneurons were suppressed. Training a classifier on fMRI signals, we were able to accurately classify cortical areas exhibiting increased E:I. This classifier was validated in an independent cohort of Fmr1y/− knockout mice, a model for autism with well-documented loss of parvalbumin neurons and chronic alterations of E:I. Our findings demonstrate a promising novel approach towards inferring microcircuit abnormalities from macroscopic fMRI measurements.},

Here, we investigate how top-down input causes frequency changes in slow oscillations during sensory processing and, in turn, how the slow oscillations are combined with fast oscillations (which encode sensory input). Using experimental connectivity patterns and strengths of interneurons, we develop a system-level model of a neuronal circuit controlling these oscillatory behaviors, allowing us to understand the mechanisms responsible for the observed oscillatory behaviors. Our analysis discovers a circuit capable of producing the observed oscillatory behaviors and finds that a detailed balance in the strength of synaptic connections is the critical determinant to produce such oscillatory behaviors. We not only uncover how disparate frequency bands are modulated and combined but also give insights into the causes of abnormal neuronal activities present in brain disorders.},

The synthesized information, collected in one place, can be used by both theorists and experimentalists. Although for commonly-studied regions cell densities could be obtained for principal cell types, overall we know very little about how many cells are present in most brain regions and even less about cell-type specific densities. There is also substantial variation in cell density values obtained from different sources. This suggests that we need a new approach to obtain cell density datasets for the mouse brain.},

Dependent on the stage, these activities can be spontaneous uncorrelated events or rhythmic oscillations generated by transient or nascent neuronal networks.Cortical interneuron activity is important for the differentiation of subtype-specific attributes such as layer settling position, morphology, synaptic specificity and molecular markers.Key aspects of interneuron development are dependent on activity-dependent mechanisms including distinct calcium signalling pathways and associated activity-mediated gene expression.Although it is now clear that activity supports the specification of cortical interneurons, the precise balance between developmental predisposition and environmental specialization remains unclear. The rapid expansion and use of new molecular techniques promise to soon provide us with a more complete understanding of how interneuron fate is specified. It will also clarify the link between crucial developmental periods and the plasticity within brain circuits required for learning and memory.},

Here we review recent work on the use of one such transformative tool in behavioral neuroscience research, chemogenetics (or Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs, DREADDS). As transformative technologies such as DREADDs are introduced, applied, and refined, their utility in addressing complex questions about behavior and cognition becomes clear and exciting. In the behavioral neuroscience field, remarkable new findings now regularly appear as a result of the ability to monitor and intervene in neural processes with high anatomical precision as animals behave in complex task environments. As these new tools are applied to behavioral questions, individualized procedures for their use find their way into diverse labs. Thus, "tips of the trade" become important for wide dissemination not only for laboratories that are using the tools but also for those who are interested in incorporating them into their own work. Our aim is to provide an up-to-date perspective on how the DREADD technique is being used for research on learning and memory, decision making, and goal-directed behavior, as well as to provide suggestions and considerations for current and future users based on our collective experience.

  abstract         = {Excitation-inhibition (E:I) imbalance is theorized as an important pathophysiological mechanism in autism. Autism affects males more frequently than females and sex-related mechanisms (e.g., X-linked genes, androgen hormones) can influence E:I balance. This suggests that E:I imbalance may affect autism differently in males versus females. With a combination of in-silico modeling and in-vivo chemogenetic manipulations in mice, we first show that a time-series metric estimated from fMRI BOLD signal, the Hurst exponent (H), can be an index for underlying change in the synaptic E:I ratio. In autism we find that H is reduced, indicating increased excitation, in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) of autistic males but not females. Increasingly intact MPFC H is also associated with heightened ability to behaviorally camouflage social-communicative difficulties, but only in autistic females. This work suggests that H in BOLD can index synaptic E:I ratio and that E:I imbalance affects autistic males and females differently.},

Subsequent screening in human cell lines facilitated the creation of a family of muscarinic acetylcholine GPCRs suitable for in vitro and in situ studies. We subsequently created lines of telomerase-immortalized human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells stably expressing all five family members and found that each one faithfully recapitulated the signaling phenotype of the parent receptor. We also expressed a Gi-coupled designer receptor in hippocampal neurons (hM4D) and demonstrated its ability to induce membrane hyperpolarization and neuronal silencing. We have thus devised a facile approach for designing families of GPCRs with engineered ligand specificities. Such reverse-engineered GPCRs will prove to be powerful tools for selectively modulating signal-transduction pathways in vitro and in vivo.},

Coherent control of nuclear spin dynamics is a powerful tool for the experimental implementation of quantum schemes in liquid and solid nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) system, especially in liquid-state NMR. Compared with other quantum information processing systems, the NMR platform has the advantages such as the long coherence time, the precise manipulation, and well-developed quantum control techniques, which make it possible to accurately control a quantum system with up to 12-qubits. Extensive applications of liquid-state NMR spectroscopy in quantum information processing such as quantum communication, quantum computing, and quantum simulation have been thoroughly studied over half a century. This article introduces the general principles of NMR quantum information processing, and reviews the new-developed techniques. The review will also include the recent achievements of the experimental realization of quantum algorithms for machine learning, quantum simulations for high energy physics, and topological order in NMR. We also discuss the limitation and prospect of liquid-state NMR spectroscopy and the solid-state NMR systems as quantum computing in the article.},

  abstract         = {Absract The inhibitory glycine receptor is a ligand-gated chloride channel of the cys-loop receptor family. As a chloride-selective channel, it mediates rapid synaptic inhibition in mammalian spinal cord, brainstem, higher brain centres and nonneuronal tissues. In recent years, our understanding of glycine receptors has steadily grown, adding considerable depth to our knowledge of receptor function, structure, cellular trafficking and tissue distribution. Furthermore, new roles for glycinergic transmission in higher brain function have been uncovered. Glycine receptors should no longer be considered only as mediators of spinal reflexes, but were also found to play an important role in the modulation of higher brain function, including vision, hearing and pain signalling. The identification of novel agonists and modulators underlines the relevance of the inhibitory glycine receptor as a therapeutic target. This review extends a previous article of this series and highlights key developments in glycine receptor research over the past 2–3 years. Key Concepts: Glycine receptors are key mediators of rapid synaptic inhibition in mammalian spinal cord and higher brain centres. Glycine receptors are members of the cys-loop family of ligand-gated ion channel receptors. Glycinergic signalling is involved in motor control, pain signalling, vision, hearing and other brain functions. Mutations in glycine receptor genes underlie human hyperekplexia and related myoclonic diseases. New modulators of glycine receptor function are rare and of considerable medicinal interest.},

  abstract         = {Epilepsy, one of the most prevalent neurological conditions, presents as a complex disorder of network homeostasis characterized by spontaneous non-provoked seizures and associated comorbidities. Currently used antiepileptic drugs have been designed to suppress neuronal hyperexcitability and thereby to suppress epileptic seizures. However, the current armamentarium of antiepileptic drugs is not effective in over 30% of patients, does not affect the comorbidities of epilepsy, and does not prevent the development and progression of epilepsy (epileptogenesis). Prevention of epilepsy and its progression remains the Holy Grail for epilepsy research and therapy development, requiring novel conceptual advances to find a solution to this urgent medical need. The methylation hypothesis of epileptogenesis suggests that changes in DNA methylation are implicated in the progression of the disease. In particular, global DNA hypermethylation appears to be associated with chronic epilepsy. Clinical as well as experimental evidence demonstrates that epilepsy and its progression can be prevented by biochemical manipulations and those that target previously unrecognized epigenetic functions contributing to epilepsy development and maintenance of the epileptic state. This mini-review will discuss, epigenetic mechanisms implicated in epileptogenesis and biochemical interactions between adenosine and glycine as a conceptual advance to understand the contribution of maladaptive changes in biochemistry as a major contributing factor to the development of epilepsy. New findings based on biochemical manipulation of the DNA methylome suggest that: (i) epigenetic mechanisms play a functional role in epileptogenesis; and (ii) therapeutic reconstruction of the epigenome is an effective antiepileptogenic therapy.},

  abstract         = {Social behaviours in species as diverse as honey bees and humans promote group survival but often come at some cost to the individual. Although reinforcement of adaptive social interactions is ostensibly required for the evolutionary persistence of these behaviours, the neural mechanisms by which social reward is encoded by the brain are largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that in mice oxytocin acts as a social reinforcement signal within the nucleus accumbens core, where it elicits a presynaptically expressed long-term depression of excitatory synaptic transmission in medium spiny neurons. Although the nucleus accumbens receives oxytocin-receptor-containing inputs from several brain regions, genetic deletion of these receptors specifically from dorsal raphe nucleus, which provides serotonergic (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) innervation to the nucleus accumbens, abolishes the reinforcing properties of social interaction. Furthermore, oxytocin-induced synaptic plasticity requires activation of nucleus accumbens 5-HT1B receptors, the blockade of which prevents social reward. These results demonstrate that the rewarding properties of social interaction in mice require the coordinated activity of oxytocin and 5-HT in the nucleus accumbens, a mechanistic insight with implications for understanding the pathogenesis of social dysfunction in neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism.},

  abstract         = {Neurons in the insular cortex are activated by acute and chronic pain, and inhibition of neuronal activity in the insular cortex has analgesic effects. We found that in a mouse model in which peripheral nerve injury leads to the development of neuropathic pain, the insular cortex showed changes in synaptic plasticity, which were associated with a long-term increase in the amount of synaptic N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), but not that of extrasynaptic NMDARs. Activation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent signaling enhanced the amount of synaptic NMDARs in acutely isolated insular cortical slices and increased the surface localization of NMDARs in cultured cortical neurons. We found that the increase in the amount of NMDARs required phosphorylation of the NMDAR subunit GluN2B at Tyr1472 by a pathway involving adenylyl cyclase subtype 1 (AC1), protein kinase A (PKA), and Src family kinases. Finally, injecting NMDAR or GluN2B-specific antagonists into the insular cortex reduced behavioral responses to normally nonnoxious stimuli in the mouse model of neuropathic pain. Our results suggest that activity-dependent plasticity takes place in the insular cortex after nerve injury and that inhibiting the increase in NMDAR function may help to prevent or treat neuropathic pain.},

In the cerebellum, tension along parallel fibres can explain why the cortex is highly elongated but folded like an accordion.

  year             = {2012},
  abstract         = {Larger mammalian cerebral cortices tend to have increasingly folded surfaces, often considered to result from the lateral expansion of the gray matter (GM), which, in a volume constrained by the cranium, causes mechanical compression that is relieved by inward folding of the white matter (WM), or to result from differential expansion of cortical layers. Across species, thinner cortices, presumably more pliable, would offer less resistance and hence become more folded than thicker cortices of a same size. However, such models do not acknowledge evidence in favor of a tension-based pull onto the GM from the inside, holding it in place even when the constraint imposed by the cranium is removed. Here we propose a testable, quantitative model of cortical folding driven by tension along the length of axons in the WM that assumes that connections through the WM are formed early in development, at the same time as the GM becomes folded, and considers that axonal connections through the WM generate tension that leads to inward folding of the WM surface, which pulls the GM surface inward. As an important necessary simplifying hypothesis, we assume that axons leaving or entering the WM do so approximately perpendicularly to the WM–GM interface. Cortical folding is thus driven by WM connectivity, and is a function of the fraction of cortical neurons connected through the WM, the average length, and the average cross-sectional area of the axons in the WM. Our model predicts that the different scaling of cortical folding across mammalian orders corresponds to different combinations of scaling of connectivity, axonal cross-sectional area, and tension along WM axons, instead of being a simple function of the number of GM neurons. Our model also explains variations in average cortical thickness as a result of the factors that lead to cortical folding, rather than as a determinant of folding; predicts that for a same tension, folding increases with connectivity through the WM and increased axonal cross-section; and that, for a same number of neurons, higher connectivity through the WM leads to a higher degree of folding as well as an on average thinner GM across species.},

The great variety of living mammals exhibit a corresponding variety of brain shapes, sizes, and patterns of fissuration and convolution of the cerebral neocortex. The view has consistently been expressed that animals with brains having greater amounts of convoluted cerebral neocortex were more intelligent as well as perceptually and behaviorally more complex.},

  abstract         = {During human brain development, the cerebral cortex undergoes substantial folding, leading to its characteristic highly convoluted form. Folding is necessary to accommodate the expansion of the cerebral cortex; abnormal cortical folding is linked to various neurological disorders, including schizophrenia, epilepsy, autism, and mental retardation. Although this process requires mechanical forces, the specific force-generating mechanisms that drive folding remain unclear. The two most widely accepted hypotheses are as follows: (1) Folding is caused by differential growth of the cortex and (2) folding is caused by mechanical tension generated in axons. Direct evidence supporting either theory, however, is lacking. Here we show that axons are indeed under considerable tension in the developing ferret brain, but the patterns of tissue stress are not consistent with a causal role for axonal tension. In particular, microdissection assays reveal that significant tension exists along axons aligned circumferentially in subcortical white matter tracts, as well as those aligned radially inside developing gyri (outward folds). Contrary to previous speculation, however, axonal tension is not directed across developing gyri, suggesting that axon tension does not drive folding. On the other hand, using computational (finite element) models, we show that differential cortical growth accompanied by remodeling of the subplate leads to outward folds and stress fields that are consistent with our microdissection experiments, supporting a mechanism involving differential growth. Local perturbations, such as temporal differences in the initiation of cortical growth, can ensure consistent folding patterns. This study shows that a combination of experimental and computational mechanics can be used to evaluate competing hypotheses of morphogenesis, and illuminate the biomechanics of cortical folding.},

  abstract         = {BACKGROUND: Recent studies have revealed the antinociceptive effects of glycine transporter (GlyT) inhibitors in neuropathic pain models such as sciatic nerve-injured and diabetic animals. Bone cancer can cause the most severe pain according to complex mechanisms in which a neuropathic element is included. Bone cancer modifies the analgesic action of opioids and limits their effectiveness, and thus novel medicament for bone cancer pain is desired. METHODS: For the femur bone cancer model, NCTC 2472 tumor cells were injected into the medullary cavity of the distal femur of C3H/HeN mice. Effects of GlyT2 inhibitors, ORG 25543 and ALX 1393, and GlyT1 inhibitors, ORG 25935, and knockdown of the expression of spinal GlyTs protein by GlyTs siRNA on pain-like behaviors, such as allodynia, withdrawal threshold, guarding behavior, and limb-use abnormality, were examined in the femur bone cancer model mice. Effects of morphine in combination with GlyT inhibitor were examined. RESULTS: GlyT2 inhibitors, ORG 25543 and ALX 1393, and GlyT1 inhibitor ORG 25935 by IV or oral administration or knockdown of the expression of spinal GlyTs protein improved pain-like behaviors at 11 days after tumor transplantation. The pain-relief activity was potent and long lasting. Morphine at a dose with no analgesic activity combined with ORG 25543 further promoted the ORG 25543-induced pain-relief activity. Injection of ORG 25543 on the second day after tumor implantation caused 3 phases of pain responses; pain-like behaviors were initially accelerated (at 2-4 days) and subsequently almost disappeared (5-7 days) and then reappeared. Intrathecal injection of strychnine 1 day after injection of ORG 25543 transiently antagonized the pain-relief activity of ORG 25543. In control mice, strychnine improved pain-like behaviors 4 days after tumor implantation and aggravated the behaviors between 4 and 5 days. The evidence suggests that the different mechanisms are phase-dependently involved. CONCLUSIONS: GlyT inhibitors with or without morphine may be a new strategy for the treatment of bone cancer pain and lead to further investigations of the mechanisms underlying the development of bone cancer pain.},

However, this extensive body of research has yielded contradictory results, there being evidence both for and against its robustness. This study provides a systematic examination of F-test robustness to violations of normality in terms of Type I error, considering a wide variety of distributions commonly found in the health and social sciences. METHOD: We conducted a Monte Carlo simulation study involving a design with three groups and several known and unknown distributions. The manipulated variables were: Equal and unequal group sample sizes; group sample size and total sample size; coefficient of sample size variation; shape of the distribution and equal or unequal shapes of the group distributions; and pairing of group size with the degree of contamination in the distribution. RESULTS: The results showed that in terms of Type I error the F-test was robust in 100% of the cases studied, independently of the manipulated conditions.},

Low back pain is the leading cause of years lived with disability both in the United States and globally and accounts for one-third of all work loss.

  abstract           = {The approach to patients with acute pain begins by identifying the underlying cause and a disease-specific treatment. The first-line pharmacologic agent for the symptomatic treatment of mild to moderate pain is acetaminophen or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). The choice between these two medications depends on the type of pain and patient risk factors for NSAID-related adverse effects (e.g., gastrointestinal, renovascular, or cardiovascular effects). Different NSAIDs have similar analgesic effects. However, cyclooxygenase-2 selective NSAIDs (e.g., celecoxib) must be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular risk factors and are more expensive than nonselective NSAIDs. If these first-line agents are not sufficient for mild to moderate pain, medications that target separate pathways simultaneously, such as an acetaminophen/opioid combination, are reasonable choices. Severe acute pain is typically treated with potent opioids. At each step, adjuvant medications directed at the underlying condition can be used. Newer medications with dual actions (e.g., tapentadol) are also an option. There is little evidence that one opioid is superior for pain control, but there are some pharmacologic differences among opioids. Because of the growing misuse and diversion of controlled substances, caution should be used when prescribing opioids, even for short-term treatment. Patients should be advised to properly dispose of unused medications.},

However, it also limits the crossing of therapeutics and thereby complicates the treatment of CNS disorders. To overcome this limitation, the use of nanocarriers for drug delivery across the BBB has recently been exploited. Nanocarriers can utilize different physiological mechanisms for drug delivery across the BBB and can be modified to achieve the desired kinetics and efficacy. Consequentially, several nanocarriers have been reported to act as functional nanomedicines in preclinical studies using animal models for human diseases. Given the rapid development of novel nanocarriers, this review provides a comprehensive insight into the most recent advancements made in nanocarrier-based drug delivery to the CNS, such as the development of multifunctional nanomedicines and theranostics.},

We studied an animal model of the human 22q11 deletion syndrome, the mutation that represents the highest genetic risk of developing schizophrenia. We observed a desynchronization of hippocampal neuronal assemblies that resulted from parvalbumin interneuron hypoexcitability. Rescuing parvalbumin interneuron excitability with pharmacological or chemogenetic approaches was sufficient to restore wild-type-like CA1 network dynamics and hippocampal-dependent behavior during adulthood. In conclusion, our data provide insights into the network dysfunction underlying schizophrenia and highlight the use of reverse engineering to restore physiological and behavioral phenotypes in an animal model of neurodevelopmental disorder.},

The development of new tools and technology has allowed investigators to classify many diverse groups of inhibitory neurons by several delineating factors: these include their connectivity motifs, expression of specific molecular markers, receptor diversity, and ultimately their role in brain function. Despite this progress, however, there is still limited understanding of how GABAergic neurons are recruited by their input and how their activity is modulated by behavioral states. This limitation is primarily due to the fact that studies of GABAergic inhibition are mainly geared toward determining how, once activated, inhibitory circuits regulate the activity of excitatory neurons. In this review article, we will outline recent work investigating the anatomical and physiological properties of inputs that activate cortical GABAergic neurons, and discuss how these inhibitory cells are differentially recruited during behavior.},

We examined the postmortem prefrontal cortical region (Brodmann's area 9) of patients with SCZ and BPD, and of age-matched control subjects, excluding suicide cases. The laminar density of neurons immunoreactive (IR) for three CBPs, namely CB, CR, and PV, was quantified. The densities of CB-IR neurons in layer 2 and PV-IR neurons in layer 4 in the SCZ subjects decreased compared with those in the control subjects. When CBP-IR neurons were classified according to their size, a reduction in the density of medium CB-IR neurons in layer 2 in SCZ subjects and an increase in the density of large CR-IR neurons in layer 2 in BPD subjects were observed. These results suggest that alterations in specific GABAergic neurons are present in mental disorders, and that such alterations may reflect the vulnerability toward the disorders.},

Consistent with this notion, excitation-inhibition imbalances are considered a pathophysiological mechanism in many brain disorders including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, methods to measure E/I ratios in human brain networks are lacking. Here, we present a method to quantify a functional E/I ratio (fE/I) from neuronal oscillations, and validate it in healthy subjects and children with ASD. We define structural E/I ratio in an in silico neuronal network, investigate how it relates to power and long-range temporal correlations (LRTC) of the network’s activity, and use these relationships to design the fE/I algorithm. Application of this algorithm to the EEGs of healthy adults showed that fE/I is balanced at the population level and is decreased through GABAergic enforcement. In children with ASD, we observed larger fE/I variability and stronger LRTC compared to typically developing children (TDC). Interestingly, visual grading for EEG abnormalities that are thought to reflect E/I imbalances revealed elevated fE/I and LRTC in ASD children with normal EEG compared to TDC or ASD with abnormal EEG. We speculate that our approach will help understand physiological heterogeneity also in other brain disorders.},

A phase 2 randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial found that the GABA-B agonist arbaclofen improved social avoidance symptoms in FXS. A pilot open-label trial of arbaclofen suggested similar benefits in ASD. We therefore evaluated arbaclofen in a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2 study of 150 participants, aged 5-21 years, with ASD. No difference from placebo was detected on the primary outcome measure, the parent-rated Aberrant Behavior Checklist Social Withdrawal/Lethargy subscale. However, a specified secondary analysis found improvement on the clinician-rated Clinical Global Impression of Severity. An exploratory post hoc analysis of participants with a consistent rater across the trial revealed greater improvement in the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales II socialization domain in participants receiving arbaclofen. Affect lability (11%) and sedation (9%) were the most common adverse events. In this exploratory study, secondary analyses suggest that arbaclofen may have the potential to improve symptoms in some children with ASD, but further study will be needed to replicate and extend these initial findings.},

However, there is a lack of evidence regarding how acute stress impacts neuronal activity, the concurrent vascular response, and the relationship between these two factors, which is defined as neurovascular coupling. Here, using in vivo two-photon imaging, we found that NMDA-evoked calcium transients of excitatory neurons were impaired and that vasodilation of penetrating arterioles was concomitantly disrupted in acutely stressed male mice. Furthermore, acute stress altered the relationship between excitatory neuronal calcium coherence and vascular responses. By measuring NMDA-evoked excitatory and inhibitory neuronal calcium activity in acute brain slices, we confirmed that neuronal coherence both between excitatory neurons and between excitatory and inhibitory neurons was reduced by acute stress but restored by blockade of glucocorticoid receptor signaling. Furthermore, the ratio of sEPSCs to sIPSCs was altered by acute stress, suggesting that the excitation-inhibition balance was disrupted by acute stress. In summary, in vivo, ex vivo, and whole-cell recording studies demonstrate that acute stress modifies excitatory-inhibitory neuronal coherence, disrupts the excitation-inhibition balance, and causes consequent neurovascular coupling changes, providing critical insights into the neural mechanism of stress-induced disorders.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Acute stress can cause pathologic conditions, such as acute stress disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder, by affecting the functions of neurons and blood vessels. However, investigations into the impacts of acute stress on neurovascular coupling, the tight connection between local neural activity and subsequent blood flow changes, are lacking. Through investigations at the in vivo, ex vivo, and whole-cell recording levels, we found that acute stress alters the NMDA-evoked vascular response, impairs the function and coherence of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, and disrupts the excitatory and inhibitory balance. These novel findings provide insights into the relevance of the excitatory-inhibitory balance, neuronal coherence, and neurovascular coupling to stress-induced disorders.},

  abstract         = {Neurovascular coupling (NVC), the interaction between neural activity and vascular response, ensures normal brain function by maintaining brain homeostasis. We previously reported altered cerebrovascular responses during functional hyperemia in chronically stressed animals. However, the underlying neuronal-level changes associated with those hemodynamic changes remained unclear. Here, using in vivo and ex vivo experiments, we investigate the neuronal origins of altered NVC dynamics under chronic stress conditions in adult male mice. Stimulus-evoked hemodynamic and neural responses, especially beta and gamma-band local field potential activity, were significantly lower in chronically stressed animals, and the NVC relationship, itself, had changed. Further, using acute brain slices, we discovered that the underlying cause of this change was dysfunction of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS)-mediated vascular responses. Using FISH to check the mRNA expression of several GABAergic subtypes, we confirmed that only nNOS mRNA was significantly decreased in chronically stressed mice. Ultimately, chronic stress impairs NVC by diminishing nNOS-mediated vasodilation responses to local neural activity. Overall, these findings provide useful information in understanding NVC dynamics in the healthy brain. More importantly, this study reveals that impaired nNOS-mediated NVC function may be a contributory factor in the progression of stress-related diseases.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The correlation between neuronal activity and cerebral vascular dynamics is defined as neurovascular coupling (NVC), which plays an important role for meeting the metabolic demands of the brain. However, the impact of chronic stress, which is a contributory factor of many cerebrovascular diseases, on NVC is poorly understood. We therefore investigated the effects of chronic stress on impaired neurovascular response to sensory stimulation and their underlying mechanisms. Multimodal approaches, from in vivo hemodynamic imaging and electrophysiology to ex vivo vascular imaging with pharmacological treatment, patch-clamp recording, FISH, and immunohistochemistry revealed that chronic stress-induced dysfunction of nNOS-expressing interneurons contributes to NVC impairment. These findings will provide useful information to understand the role of nNOS interneurons in NVC in normal and pathological conditions.},

Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADD)-based chemogenetic tools are now commonly used by neuroscientists to identify the circuitry and cellular signals that specify behavior, perceptions, emotions, innate drives, and motor functions in species ranging from flies to nonhuman primates. Here I provide a primer on DREADDs highlighting key technical and conceptual considerations and identify challenges for chemogenetics going forward.},

  abstract         = {Functional neuroimaging has provided evidence for altered function of mesolimbic circuits implicated in reward processing, first and foremost the ventral striatum, in patients with schizophrenia. While such findings based on significant group differences in brain activations can provide important insights into the pathomechanisms of mental disorders, the use of neuroimaging results from standard univariate statistical analysis for individual diagnosis has proven difficult. In this proof of concept study, we tested whether the predictive accuracy for the diagnostic classification of schizophrenia patients vs. healthy controls could be improved using multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) of regional functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activation patterns for the anticipation of monetary reward. With a searchlight MVPA approach using support vector machine classification, we found that the diagnostic category could be predicted from local activation patterns in frontal, temporal, occipital and midbrain regions, with a maximal cluster peak classification accuracy of 93% for the right pallidum. Region-of-interest based MVPA for the ventral striatum achieved a maximal cluster peak accuracy of 88%, whereas the classification accuracy on the basis of standard univariate analysis reached only 75%. Moreover, using support vector regression we could additionally predict the severity of negative symptoms from ventral striatal activation patterns. These results show that MVPA can be used to substantially increase the accuracy of diagnostic classification on the basis of task-related fMRI signal patterns in a regionally specific way.},

Existing methods for K-NNG construction either do not scale, or are specific to certain similarity measures. We present NN-Descent, a simple yet efficient algorithm for approximate K-NNG construction with arbitrary similarity measures. Our method is based on local search, has minimal space overhead and does not rely on any shared global index. Hence, it is especially suitable for large-scale applications where data structures need to be distributed over the network. We have shown with a variety of datasets and similarity measures that the proposed method typically converges to above 90% recall with each point comparing only to several percent of the whole dataset on average.},

First, the standard model for a thermodynamic system is derived using the recently discovered potential-descending principle (PDP), addressed in Chap. 7. Second, all equilibrium phase transitions are fully characterized by three basic theorems. Third, the dynamical law of fluctuations is derived, and we show that the standard model, together with the dynamic law of fluctuation, offers correct information for critical exponents. Fourth, the theory is applied to gas-liquid transitions, ferromagnetism, binary systems, superconductivity, and liquid heliums, leading to various physical predictions and insights to the underlying physical problems.},

A potential solution may lie in a unique aspect of neurobiology, which is that numerous brain systems contain diffuse synaptic connectivity. Here, we demonstrate that increasing diffuse cortical coupling within a validated biophysical corticothalamic model traverses the system through a quasi-critical regime in which spatial heterogeneities in input noise support transient critical dynamics in distributed subregions. The presence of quasi-critical states coincides with known signatures of complex, adaptive brain network dynamics. Finally, we demonstrate the presence of similar dynamic signatures in empirical whole-brain human neuroimaging data. Together, our results establish that modulating the balance between local and diffuse synaptic coupling in a thalamocortical model subtends the emergence of quasi-critical brain states that act to flexibly transition the brain between unique modes of information processing.},

Here we investigated the spatial, dynamic, and molecular signatures of system-wide neural activity across a range of cognitive tasks. We found that neuronal activity converged onto a low-dimensional manifold that facilitates the execution of diverse task states. Flow within this attractor space was associated with dissociable cognitive functions, unique patterns of network-level topology, and individual differences in fluid intelligence. The axes of the low-dimensional neurocognitive architecture aligned with regional differences in the density of neuromodulatory receptors, which in turn relate to distinct signatures of network controllability estimated from the structural connectome. These results advance our understanding of functional brain organization by emphasizing the interface between neural activity, neuromodulatory systems, and cognitive function.},

This specialization of function is thought to be underpinned by corresponding changes in the brain{\textquoteright}s local circuitry. Here we combine a wide range of measurements across the mouse brain, including the expression of genes, cell densities, and axonal connectivity, to show that the properties of local circuits of the mouse brain vary along putative processing streams in a similar way to the primate brain. This similarity across species points to common mechanisms through which mammalian brains may process information.The primate cerebral cortex displays a hierarchy that extends from primary sensorimotor to association areas, supporting increasingly integrated function underpinned by a gradient of heterogeneity in the brain{\textquoteright}s microcircuits. The extent to which these hierarchical gradients are unique to primate or may reflect a conserved mammalian principle of brain organization remains unknown. Here we report the topographic similarity of large-scale gradients in cytoarchitecture, gene expression, interneuron cell densities, and long-range axonal connectivity, which vary from primary sensory to prefrontal areas of mouse cortex, highlighting an underappreciated spatial dimension of mouse cortical specialization. Using the T1-weighted:T2-weighted (T1w:T2w) magnetic resonance imaging map as a common spatial reference for comparison across species, we report interspecies agreement in a range of large-scale cortical gradients, including a significant correspondence between gene transcriptional maps in mouse cortex with their human orthologs in human cortex, as well as notable interspecies differences. Our results support the view of systematic structural variation across cortical areas as a core organizational principle that may underlie hierarchical specialization in mammalian brains.},

We used empirical time series from five freshwater ecosystems with documented sudden, persistent transitions hypothesized to represent critical transitions. EWIs were detected in several of these long-term records, and in some cases several years before the transition; however, these EWIs varied in reliability, and agreement between indicators was low. Moreover, their applicability was strongly limited by the requirement for ecosystem-specific knowledge of transition-generating mechanisms and their drivers to choose relevant state variables for analysis.Ecosystems can show sudden and persistent changes in state despite only incremental changes in drivers. Such critical transitions are difficult to predict, because the state of the system often shows little change before the transition. Early-warning indicators (EWIs) are hypothesized to signal the loss of system resilience and have been shown to precede critical transitions in theoretical models, paleo-climate time series, and in laboratory as well as whole lake experiments. The generalizability of EWIs for detecting critical transitions in empirical time series of natural aquatic ecosystems remains largely untested, however. Here we assessed four commonly used EWIs on long-term datasets of five freshwater ecosystems that have experienced sudden, persistent transitions and for which the relevant ecological mechanisms and drivers are well understood. These case studies were categorized by three mechanisms that can generate critical transitions between alternative states: competition, trophic cascade, and intraguild predation. Although EWIs could be detected in most of the case studies, agreement among the four indicators was low. In some cases, EWIs were detected considerably ahead of the transition. Nonetheless, our results show that at present, EWIs do not provide reliable and consistent signals of impending critical transitions despite using some of the best routinely monitored freshwater ecosystems. Our analysis strongly suggests that a priori knowledge of the underlying mechanisms driving ecosystem transitions is necessary to identify relevant state variables for successfully monitoring EWIs.},

Of considerable interest are bifurcations, small smooth changes in underlying drivers that produce abrupt shifts in system state. Before reaching the bifurcation point, the system gradually loses stability (‘critical slowing down’). Signals of critical slowing down may be detected through measurement of summary statistics, but how extrinsic and intrinsic noises influence statistical patterns prior to a transition is unclear. Here, we consider a range of stochastic models that exhibit transcritical, saddle-node and pitchfork bifurcations. Noise was assumed to be either intrinsic or extrinsic. We derived expressions for the stationary variance, autocorrelation and power spectrum for all cases. Trends in summary statistics signaling the approach of each bifurcation depend on the form of noise. For example, models with intrinsic stochasticity may predict an increase in or a decline in variance as the bifurcation parameter changes, whereas models with extrinsic noise applied additively predict an increase in variance. The ability to classify trends of summary statistics for a broad class of models enhances our understanding of how critical slowing down manifests in complex systems approaching a transition.},

We studied the dynamics of single neurons in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and putamen of monkeys while they learned new classification tasks every few days over a fixed set of multi-cue patterns. Representing the rules and the neuronal selectivity as vectors in the space spanned by a set of stimulus features allowed us to characterize neuronal dynamics in geometrical terms. We found that neurons in the cingulate cortex mainly rotated toward the rule, implying a policy search, whereas neurons in the putamen showed a magnitude increase that followed the rotation of cortical neurons, implying strengthening of confidence for the newly acquired rule-based policy. Further, the neural representation at the end of a session predicted next-day behavior, reflecting overnight retention. The novel framework for characterization of neural dynamics suggests complementing roles for the putamen and the anterior cingulate cortex.},

Given that standard theoretical and data analysis approaches usually rely on the assumption of stationarity, it is important to detect in real time series intervals holding that property. With that aim, we introduce a segmentation algorithm based on a fully nonparametric approach. We illustrate its applicability through the analysis of real time series presenting diverse degrees of nonstationarity, thus showing that this segmentation procedure generalizes and allows one to uncover features unresolved by previous proposals based on the discrepancy of low order statistical moments only.},

  abstract         = {Many phenomena, both natural and human influenced, give rise to signals whose statistical properties change under time translation, i.e., are nonstationary. For some practical purposes, a nonstationary time series can be seen as a concatenation of stationary segments. However, the exact segmentation of a nonstationary time series is a hard computational problem which cannot be solved exactly by existing methods. For this reason, heuristic methods have been proposed. Using one such method, it has been reported that for several cases of interest—e.g., heart beat data and Internet traffic fluctuations—the distribution of durations of these stationary segments decays with a power-law tail. A potential technical difficulty that has not been thoroughly investigated is that a nonstationary time series with a (scalefree) power-law distribution of stationary segments is harder to segment than other nonstationary time series because of the wider range of possible segment lengths. Here, we investigate the validity of a heuristic segmentation algorithm recently proposed by Bernaola-Galván et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 87, 168105 (2001)] by systematically analyzing surrogate time series with different statistical properties. We find that if a given nonstationary time series has stationary periods whose length is distributed as a power law, the algorithm can split the time series into a set of stationary segments with the correct statistical properties. We also find that the estimated power-law exponent of the distribution of stationary-segment lengths is affected by (i) the minimum segment length and (ii) the ratio R≡σε/σ¯x, where σ¯x is the standard deviation of the mean values of the segments and σε is the standard deviation of the fluctuations within a segment. Furthermore, we determine that the performance of the algorithm is generally not affected by uncorrelated noise spikes or by weak long-range temporal correlations of the fluctuations within segments.},

Here we explore some properties of both natural and horizontal visibility graphs associated to several nonstationary processes, and we pay particular attention to their capacity to assess time irreversibility. Nonstationary signals are (infinitely) irreversible by definition (independently of whether the process is Markovian or producing entropy at a positive rate), and thus the link between entropy production and time series irreversibility has only been explored in nonequilibrium stationary states. Here we show that the visibility formalism naturally induces a new working definition of time irreversibility, which allows us to quantify several degrees of irreversibility for stationary and nonstationary series, yielding finite values that can be used to efficiently assess the presence of memory and off-equilibrium dynamics in nonstationary processes without the need to differentiate or detrend them. We provide rigorous results complemented by extensive numerical simulations on several classes of stochastic processes.},

Applying the empirical modeling technique to electroencephalogram (EEG) records analysis, we find evidence of high-dimensional nonlinear dynamics in quasistationary EEG segments. Reccurence analysis of model parameters reveals long-term correlations in nonstationary EEG records.

Such data are widespread, including, for example, intercorrelations of survey items, direct ratings on the similarity on choice objects, or trade indices for a set of countries. MDS represents the data as distances among points in a geometric space of low dimensionality. This map can help to see patterns in the data that are not obvious from the data matrices. MDS is also used as a psychological model for judgments of similarity and preference. This book may be used as an introduction to MDS for students in psychology, sociology, and marketing. The prerequisite is an elementary background in statistics. The book is also well suited for a variety of advanced courses on MDS topics. All the mathematics required for more advanced topics is developed systematically. This second edition is not only a complete overhaul of its predecessor, but also adds some 140 pages of new material. Many chapters are revised or have sections reflecting new insights and developments in MDS. There are two new chapters, one on asymmetric models and the other on unfolding. There are also numerous exercises that help the reader to practice what he or she has learned, and to delve deeper into the models and its intricacies. These exercises make it easier to use this edition in a course. All data sets used in the book can be downloaded from the web. The appendix on computer programs has also been updated and enlarged to reflect the state of the art. Ingwer Borg is Scientific Director at the Center for Survey Methodology (ZUMA) in Mannheim, Germany, and Professor of Psychology at the University of Giessen, Germany. He has authored or edited 14 books and numerous articles on data analysis, survey research, theory construction, and various substantive topics of psychology.

In this paper, we investigated the stationarity and linearity of resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) time series data from the Midnight Scan Club datasets. The degree of stationarity (DS) and degree of nonlinearity (DN) were respectively estimated for the time series of all gray matter voxels. The similarity and difference between the DS and DN were assessed in terms of voxels, and intrinsic brain networks including the visual network, somatomotor network, dorsal attention network, ventral attention, limbic network, frontoparietal network, and default mode network. The test-retest scans were utilized to quantify the reliability of DS and DN. We found that DS and DN maps had overlapping spatial distribution. Meanwhile, the probability density estimate function of DS had a long tail and that of DN had a more normal distribution. Specifically, stronger DS was present in the somatomotor, limbic and ventral attention networks compared to other networks, and stronger DN was found in the somatomotor, visual, limbic, ventral attention, and default mode networks. The percentage of overlapping voxels between DS and DN demonstrated a decreasing trend from default mode, ventral attention, somatomotor, frontoparietal, dorsal attention, visual, and limbic networks. Furthermore, the ICC values of DS were higher than those of DN. Our results suggest that different functional networks have distinct nonstationarity and nonlinear properties owing to the complexity of rs-fMRI time series. Thus, caution should be taken when analyzing fMRI data (both resting state and task activation) using simplified models.},

The methods discussed are based upon error bounding and adaptive estimation, and assessment of the relative efficacy of each method is carried out by the use of simulation experiments with two models of parameter variation: deterministic parameter changes, and an autoregressive model of parameter changes. It is concluded from this analysis that estimation based upon exponential data weighting, the random walk model, and Sage-Husa filter will usually be best in a variety of situations.},

Due to the nonstationarity of this process and the combinatorial nature of such a formalism, its parameters have been estimated mostly by fitting the numerical approximation of the associated non-Gaussian probability density function to empirical data, cf. Castaing et al. [Physica D 46, 177 (1990)]. More recently, alternative estimators based upon various moments have been proposed by Beck [Physica D 193, 195 (2004)] and Kiyono et al. [Phys. Rev. E 76, 041113 (2007)]. In this paper, we pursue this moment-based approach further and develop a more rigorous generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation procedure to cope with the documented difficulties of previous methodologies. We show that even under uncertainty about the actual number of cascade steps, our methodology yields very reliable results for the estimated intermittency parameter. Employing the Levinson-Durbin algorithm for best linear forecasts, we also show that estimated parameters can be used for forecasting the evolution of the turbulent flow. We compare forecasting results from the GMM and Kiyono et al.'s procedure via Monte Carlo simulations. We finally test the applicability of our approach by estimating the intermittency parameter and forecasting of volatility for a sample of financial data from stock and foreign exchange markets.},

Following a comparison with existing methods in a simulated environment, dimension expansion is studied on a classic test-bed dataset historically used to study nonstationary models. Following this, we explore the use of dimension expansion in modeling air pollution in the United Kingdom, a process known to be strongly influenced by rural/urban effects, amongst others, which gives rise to a nonstationary field.},

Periodic formulations for two classes of time series models are considered: seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average and unobserved components models. Convenient state space representations of the periodic models are proposed to facilitate model identification, specification and exact maximum likelihood estimation of the periodic parameters. These formulations do not require a priori (seasonal) differencing of the time series. The time-varying state space representation is an attractive alternative to the time-invariant vector representation of periodic models which typically leads to a high dimensional state vector in monthly periodic time series models. A key development is our method for computing the variance–covariance matrix of the initial set of observations which is required for exact maximum likelihood estimation. The two classes of periodic models are illustrated for a monthly postwar US unemployment time series.},

  abstract         = {Experimental data from single-molecule DNA-protein experiments, such as experiments using optical traps or magnetic tweezers, typically contain steps, plateaus, or dwell regions that are obscured by thermal and other noise sources. We present a nonparametric method for detecting step-like features in noisy biological data sets. Our algorithm does not assume that the steps can be modeled as Heaviside functions or any particular parametric form. No assumptions about the noise source, such as whether the noise is Gaussian or colored, are made either. Instead, for detection of plateaus, the algorithm uses the novel method of analyzing a probability distribution function of the data values. The vast majority of previously published methods for step detection rely on statistical fitting of step functions with the flat segments linked by vertical segments. Our approach is intended for use on data which cannot be modelled as a series of step functions but applies to step functions as a special case. These type of data traces have, so far, been difficult to characterize effectively. We examine the performance of the algorithm through systematic simulation studies and illustrate the use of our algorithm to analyze single molecule DNA-protein micromanipulation experiments carried out by our laboratory. The simulation results and experimental validation suggest that our method is very robust, avoids overfitting, and functions effectively in the presence of noise sources characteristic of single molecule experiments. © 2015 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry},

For example, in exploration geosciences, noisy drill hole records need to be separated into stratigraphic zones, and in biophysics, jumps between molecular dwell states have to be extracted from noisy fluorescence microscopy signals. Many PWC denoising methods exist, including total variation regularization, mean shift clustering, stepwise jump placement, running medians, convex clustering shrinkage and bilateral filtering; conventional linear signal processing methods are fundamentally unsuited. This paper (part I, the first of two) shows that most of these methods are associated with a special case of a generalized functional, minimized to achieve PWC denoising. The minimizer can be obtained by diverse solver algorithms, including stepwise jump placement, convex programming, finite differences, iterated running medians, least angle regression, regularization path following and coordinate descent. In the second paper, part II, we introduce novel PWC denoising methods, and comparisons between these methods performed on synthetic and real signals, showing that the new understanding of the problem gained in part I leads to new methods that have a useful role to play.},

It shows how the minimizer can be obtained by a range of computational solver algorithms.

We further discuss the introduction of priors on the model parameters for situations where excitation is insufficient for identification. The identification problems are cast as convex optimization problems and are applicable to, e.g., ARX models and state-space models with time-varying parameters.

The proposed model is based on the time-frequency representation of a process, which is essential for capturing the nonstationary characteristics of earthquake ground motions. Stationary wavelet transform is first utilized to decompose a sample of a multicomponent nonstationary random process into a set of monocomponent signals. These signals are subsequently transformed to analytic signals using the Hilbert transform, which yields the instantaneous amplitudes and frequencies. Without the customary assumption of piecewise stationarity or reliance on an assumed modulation function, this approach is able to simulate nonstationary random processes, such as earthquake ground motion, based on a sample realization of the process and its instantaneous features. The method is extended to the simulation of multivariate random processes utilizing the proper orthogonal decomposition. Example simulations of measured ground-motion records are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed scheme. Utilization of this method for simulation of gust fronts is also discussed, further emphasizing the utility of this new framework for the simulation of a host of nonstationary processes with their respective features.},

  abstract         = {This paper presents a rigorous derivation of a previously known formula for simulation of one-dimensional, univariate, nonstationary stochastic processes integrating Priestly’s evolutionary spectral representation theory. Applying this formula, sample functions can be generated with great computational efficiency. The simulated stochastic process is asymptotically Gaussian as the number of terms tends to infinity. This paper shows that (1) these sample functions accurately reflect the prescribed probabilistic characteristics of the stochastic process when the number of terms in the cosine series is large, i.e., the ensemble averaged evolutionary power spectral density function (PSDF) or autocorrelation function approaches the corresponding target function as the sample size increases, and (2) the simulation formula, under certain conditions, can be reduced to that for nonstationary white noise process or Shinozuka’s spectral representation of stationary process. In addition to derivation of simulation formula, three methods are developed in this paper to estimate the evolutionary PSDF of a given time-history data by means of the short-time Fourier transform (STFT), the wavelet transform (WT), and the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT). A comparison of the PSDF of the well-known El Centro earthquake record estimated by these methods shows that the STFT and the WT give similar results, whereas the HHT gives more concentrated energy at certain frequencies. Effectiveness of the proposed simulation formula for nonstationary sample functions is demonstrated by simulating time histories from the estimated evolutionary PSDFs. Mean acceleration spectrum obtained by averaging the spectra of generated time histories are then presented and compared with the target spectrum to demonstrate the usefulness of this method.},

The reduced series can then be resimulated in the frequency or time domain. The present series is resimulated in the frequency domain via a target spectrum, the spectrum of the reduced series. Inverse procedures are then utilized to simulate the original series.

Inertial measurement units (IMU) measure acceleration and rotational velocity which makes them attractive devises for gait analysis. The aim of this study was to compare three different methods for step detection from IMU data from turkeys. This is an essential step for future feature extraction for the evaluation of turkey locomotion. Data from turkeys walking through a corridor with IMUs attached to each upper leg were annotated manually. We evaluated change point detection, local extrema approach, and gradient boosting machine in terms of step detection and precision of start and end point of the steps. All three methods were successful in step detection, but local extrema approach showed more false detections. In terms of precision of start and end point of steps, change point detection performed poorly due to significant irregular delay, while gradient boosting machine was most precise. For the allowed distance to the annotated steps of 0.2s, the precision of gradient boosting machine was 0.81 and the recall was 0.84, which is much better in comparison to the other two methods ({\textless}0.61). At an allowed distance of 1s performance of the three models was similar. Gradient boosting machine was identified as the most accurate for signal segmentation with final goal to extract information about turkey gait, however it requires an annotated training dataset.},

  abstract         = {The paradigm of deterministic chaos has influenced thinking in many fields of science. Chaotic systems show rich and surprising mathematical structures. In the applied sciences, deterministic chaos provides a striking explanation for irregular behaviour and anomalies in systems which do not seem to be inherently stochastic. The most direct link between chaos theory and the real world is the analysis of time series from real systems in terms of nonlinear dynamics. Experimental technique and data analysis have seen such dramatic progress that, by now, most fundamental properties of nonlinear dynamical systems have been observed in the laboratory. Great efforts are being made to exploit ideas from chaos theory wherever the data displays more structure than can be captured by traditional methods. Problems of this kind are typical in biology and physiology but also in geophysics, economics, and many other sciences.},

  abstract         = {Synchronous activity of cortical inhibitory interneurons expressing parvalbumin (PV) underlies expression of cortical gamma rhythms. Paradoxically, deficient PV inhibition is associated with increased broadband gamma power in the local field potential (LFP). Increased baseline broadband gamma is also a prominent characteristic in schizophrenia and a hallmark of network alterations induced by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists such as ketamine. Whether enhanced broadband gamma is a true rhythm, and if so, whether rhythmic PV inhibition is involved or not, is debated. Asynchronous and increased firing activities are thought to contribute to broadband power increases spanning the gamma band. Using male and female mice lacking NMDAR activity specifically in PV neurons to model deficient PV inhibition, we here show that neuronal activity with decreased synchronicity is associated with increased prefrontal broadband gamma power. Specifically, reduced spike time precision and spectral leakage of spiking activity due to higher firing rates (spike “contamination”) affect the broadband gamma band. Desynchronization was evident at multiple time scales, with reduced spike entrainment to the LFP, reduced cross-frequency coupling, and fragmentation of brain states. Local application of S(+)-ketamine in (control) mice with intact NMDAR activity in PV neurons triggered network desynchronization and enhanced broadband gamma power. However, our investigations suggest that disparate mechanisms underlie increased broadband gamma power caused by genetic alteration of PV interneurons and ketamine-induced power increases in broadband gamma. Our study confirms that enhanced broadband gamma power can arise from asynchronous activities and demonstrates that long-term deficiency of PV inhibition can be a contributor.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT
Brain oscillations are fundamental to the coordination of neuronal activity across neurons and structures. Gamma oscillations (30-80 Hz) have received particular attention through their association with perceptual and cognitive processes. Synchronous activity of inhibitory PV interneurons generates cortical gamma oscillation, but, paradoxically, PV neuron deficiency is associated with increases in gamma oscillations. We here reconcile this conundrum and show how deficient PV inhibition can lead to increased and asynchronous excitatory firing, contaminating the LFP and manifesting as increased gamma power. Thus, increased gamma power does not always reflect a genuine rhythm. Further, we show that ketamine-induced gamma increases are caused by separate network mechanisms.},

Particular emphasis is given to emerging research that facilitates wide comparison of feature-based representations that allow us to understand the properties of a time-series dataset that make it suited to a particular feature-based representation or analysis algorithm. The future of time-series analysis is likely to embrace approaches that exploit machine learning methods to partially automate human learning to aid understanding of the complex dynamical patterns in the time series we measure from the world.},

In this paper, the transition from the dynamic equation to the ARMA model is described and the algorithms of identification are explained, for the very common case of uncontrolled and unmeasured excitation. These techniques, the qualities of which have been established during extensive processing of offshore structures measurements, have been generalized to more complex excitation models such as those of turbo-alternators.

However, recurrence computation is highly expensive as the size of time series increases. Few, if any, previous approaches have been capable of quantifying the recurrence properties from a long-term time series, while which is often collected in the real-time monitoring of complex systems. This paper presents a novel multiscale framework to explore recurrence dynamics in complex systems and resolve computational issues for a large-scale dataset. As opposed to the traditional single-scale recurrence analysis, we characterize and quantify recurrence dynamics in multiple wavelet scales, which captures not only nonlinear but also nonstationary behaviors in a long-term time series. The proposed multiscale recurrence approach was utilized to identify heart failure subjects from the 24-h time series of heart rate variability (HRV). It was shown to identify the conditions of congestive heart failure with an average sensitivity of 92.1% and specificity of 94.7%. The proposed multiscale recurrence framework can be potentially extended to other nonlinear dynamic methods that are computationally expensive for large-scale datasets.},

We present a new method that makes maximum likelihood estimation feasible for partially-observed nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems (also known as state-space models) where this was not previously the case. The method is based on a sequence of filtering operations which are shown to converge to a maximum likelihood parameter estimate. We make use of recent advances in nonlinear filtering in the implementation of the algorithm. We apply the method to the study of cholera in Bangladesh. We construct confidence intervals, perform residual analysis, and apply other diagnostics. Our analysis, based upon a model capturing the intrinsic nonlinear dynamics of the system, reveals some effects overlooked by previous studies.},

Here we show that signals that are nonlinear, non-stationary, non-gaussian, and discontinuous can be described by expanding the probabilistic dependence of the future on the past around local models of their relationship. The predictors derived from this general framework have the form of the global combinations of local functions that are used in statistics2,3,4, machine learning5,6,7,8,9,10 and studies of nonlinear dynamics11,12.

  abstract         = {Many real-life dynamical systems experience abrupt changes followed by almost stationary periods. In this paper, we consider streams of data exhibiting such abrupt behavior and investigate the problem of tracking their statistical properties in an online manner. Wedevise a tracking procedure where an estimator that is suitable for a stationary environment is combined together with an estimator suitable for a dynamic environment. The current estimate is based on the stationary estimator unless a statistically significant difference is observed between both estimators. The stationary estimate is deemed off track and a large update (jump) is given to get the stationary estimate back on track. We use the Stochastic Learning Weak Estimator (SLWE) as the dynamic estimator. The SLWE is known to be the state-of-the art solution to tracking the properties of non-stationary environments, due to its multiplicative update form. Therefore, the SLWE is a better choice to accompany a stationary estimator than the far more common sliding window based approach. A theoretically well founded statistical testing procedure is developed to detect a significant difference between the stationary and dynamical estimators. Although our procedure bears similarities to the event detection procedure suggested by Ross et al. (Pattern Recogn Lett, 33(2):191-198, 2012), it is rather well founded theoretically. First, Ross et al. ignore the uncertainty in the stationary estimator in the detection procedure. Second, the detection threshold is determined based on heuristics and therefore lacks a solid statistical foundation. Extensive simulation results, based on both synthetic and real-life data related to news topic classification, demonstrate that our estimation procedure is easy to tune and outperforms legacy works.},

  abstract         = {The field of prognostics has attracted significant interest from the research community in recent times. Prognostics enables the prediction of failures in machines resulting in benefits to plant operators such as shorter downtimes, higher operation reliability, reduced operations and maintenance cost, and more effective maintenance and logistics planning. Prognostic systems have been successfully deployed for the monitoring of relatively simple rotating machines. However, machines and associated systems today are increasingly complex. As such, there is an urgent need to develop prognostic techniques for such complex systems operating in the real world. This review paper focuses on prognostic techniques that can be applied to rotating machinery operating under non-linear and non-stationary conditions. The general concept of these techniques, the pros and cons of applying these methods, as well as their applications in the research field are discussed. Finally, the opportunities and challenges in implementing prognostic systems and developing effective techniques for monitoring machines operating under non-stationary and non-linear conditions are also discussed.},

  abstract         = {Information theory allows us to investigate information processing in neural systems in terms of information transfer, storage and modification. Especially the measure of information transfer, transfer entropy, has seen a dramatic surge of interest in neuroscience. Estimating transfer entropy from two processes requires the observation of multiple realizations of these processes to estimate associated probability density functions. To obtain these necessary observations, available estimators typically assume stationarity of processes to allow pooling of observations over time. This assumption however, is a major obstacle to the application of these estimators in neuroscience as observed processes are often non-stationary. As a solution, Gomez-Herrero and colleagues theoretically showed that the stationarity assumption may be avoided by estimating transfer entropy from an ensemble of realizations. Such an ensemble of realizations is often readily available in neuroscience experiments in the form of experimental trials. Thus, in this work we combine the ensemble method with a recently proposed transfer entropy estimator to make transfer entropy estimation applicable to non-stationary time series. We present an efficient implementation of the approach that is suitable for the increased computational demand of the ensemble method's practical application. In particular, we use a massively parallel implementation for a graphics processing unit to handle the computationally most heavy aspects of the ensemble method for transfer entropy estimation. We test the performance and robustness of our implementation on data from numerical simulations of stochastic processes. We also demonstrate the applicability of the ensemble method to magnetoencephalographic data. While we mainly evaluate the proposed method for neuroscience data, we expect it to be applicable in a variety of fields that are concerned with the analysis of information transfer in complex biological, social, and artificial systems.},

Following the context, the methods defined around the concept of Recurrence Plot Analysis (RPA) constitute an interesting way of analyzing non-stationary signals and, particularly, the transient ones. Starting from the phase space and the recurrence matrix, new approaches [the angular distance, recurrence-based autocorrelation function (ACF), average-magnitude difference function (AMDF) and time-distributed recurrence (TDR)] are introduced in order to extract information about the non-stationary signals, specific to different applications. Comparisons with existing analysis methods are presented, proving the interest and the potential of the RPA-based approaches.},

Standard approaches assume stationarity of the observations, and therefore are unable to track time-varying changes in nonlinear information transfer with high temporal resolution. In this study, we aim to define and validate novel instantaneous measures of TE to provide an improved assessment of complex nonstationary cardiorespiratory interactions. Methods: We here propose a novel instantaneous point-process TE (ipTE) and validate its assessment as applied to cardiovascular and cardiorespiratory dynamics. In particular, heartbeat and respiratory dynamics are characterized through discrete time series, and modeled with probability density functions predicting the time of the next physiological event as a function of the past history. Likewise, nonstationary interactions between heartbeat and blood pressure dynamics are characterized as well. Furthermore, we propose a new measure of information transfer, the instantaneous point-process information transfer (ipInfTr), which is directly derived from point-process-based definitions of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance. Results and Conclusion: Analysis on synthetic data, as well as on experimental data gathered from healthy subjects undergoing postural changes confirms that ipTE, as well as ipInfTr measures are able to dynamically track changes in physiological systems coupling. Significance: This novel approach opens new avenues in the study of hidden, transient, nonstationary physiological states involving multivariate autonomic dynamics in cardiovascular health and disease. The proposed method can also be tailored for the study of complex multisystem physiology (e.g., brain-heart or, more in general, brain-body interactions).},

These time series are corrupted by molecular and experimental noise that requires removal, but classical signal processing is of limited use for recovering such step-like dynamics. This paper reports simple, novel Bayesian filters that are robust to step-like dynamics in noise, and introduce an L1-regularized, global filter whose sparse solution can be rapidly obtained by standard convex optimization methods. We show these techniques outperforming classical filters on simulated time series in terms of their ability to accurately recover the underlying step dynamics.

Typical types of behaviors of the parametrically excited double pendula are presented, including chaos, rotations and periodic oscillations, and the bifurcation analysis is performed, exhibiting complex transitions from one type of motion into another. The character of the observed dynamics is analyzed using Lyapunov exponents, which confirms the hyperchaotic nature of the system. Particular attention is paid to the transient behaviors, showing that the length of the irregular motion can be extremely sensitive to both parameters and initial conditions. Apart from the single double pendulum, we consider also the case of two coupled double pendula, connected by a typical linear scheme. Our results show that depending on the network’s parameters, one can observe the phenomenon of a transient chaotic synchronization, during which the units spontaneously synchronize and desynchronize. The loss of coherence is strictly related to the motion of the pendula around the unstable equilibrium of the system, which has been confirmed in the scenario of pure chaotic oscillations. We determine the regions of the occurrence of transient synchronization in the coupling parameters’ plane, as well as study the statistical properties of the observed patterns. We show that the problem of determining the final dynamical attractor of the system is not straightforward.},

Al doping improves resistance to crystal growth{,} stress release and oxidation resistance of the coatings.

First-principles and quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA) studies on bulk CrN and AlN were incorporated to predict the thermo-elastic properties of Cr1−xAlxN thin film coatings in the temperature range of 0–1500 °C. The simulated results at T = 1500 °C give a predicted hardness of H = ∼41.5 GPa for a ∼21% Al doped Cr1−xAlxN coating.},

SR-based characterization methods can be employed to analyze different systems such as powders, thin films, and bulk forms having complex crystalline or amorphous structures. In this review, peculiarities of SR are briefly explained. Moreover, various techniques carried out utilizing this instrument for material characterization such as X-ray powder diffraction, grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction, small/wide-angle X-ray scattering, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, different techniques of X-ray imaging, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray microprobes/nanoprobes are presented. As a result, by shedding light on the advantages of SR and its superiority to the equivalent laboratory experiments, researchers are recommended to exploit the capabilities of this invaluable tool in their materials characterization.},

  abstract         = {Abstract Current studies of cell signaling dynamics that use live cell fluorescent biosensors routinely yield thousands of single-cell, heterogeneous, multi-dimensional trajectories. Typically, the extraction of relevant information from time series data relies on predefined, human-interpretable features. Without a priori knowledge of the system, the predefined features may fail to cover the entire spectrum of dynamics. Here we present CODEX, a data-driven approach based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that identifies patterns in time series. It does not require a priori information about the biological system and the insights into the data are built through explanations of the CNNs' predictions. CODEX provides several views of the data: visualization of all the single-cell trajectories in a low-dimensional space, identification of prototypic trajectories, and extraction of distinctive motifs. We demonstrate how CODEX can provide new insights into ERK and Akt signaling in response to various growth factors, and we recapitulate findings in p53 and TGF?-SMAD2 signaling.},

An exact solution to this simplified dynamical system is given which serves as the limit for strong forcing and appears to be a new integrable case of the Lorenz equations. For small values of the bifurcation parameter, an approximate, analytical and multipeaked map is obtained which gives successive periods of the pulse-like motion. This map leads to self-similar behaviour in parameter-space.},

In the present paper, regarding the delay as parameter, we investigate the effect of delay on the dynamics of Chen's system with delayed feedback. We first consider the effect of delay on the steady states, and then investigate the existence of local Hopf bifurcations. By using the normal form theory and center manifold argument, we derive the explicit formulas determining the stability, direction and other properties of bifurcating periodic solutions. Finally, we give several numerical simulations, which indicate that when the delay passes through certain critical values, chaotic oscillation is converted into a stable steady state or a stable periodic orbit.},

  abstract         = {In the present contribution, an asymmetric central contraction mutation (ACCM) model is proposed to enhance the Ikeda time delay system. The modified Ikeda system model is designed by introducing a superimposed tanh function term into the sine nonlinearity term. Stability and Hopf bifurcation characteristics of the system are analyzed theoretically. Numerical simulations, carried out in terms of bifurcation diagrams, Lyapunov exponents spectrum, phase portraits, and two-parameter (2D) largest Lyapunov exponent diagrams are employed to highlight the complex dynamical behaviors exhibited by the enhanced system. The results indicate that the modified system has rich dynamical behaviors including limit cycle, multiscroll hyperchaos, chaos, and hyperchaos. Moreover, as a major outcome of this paper, considering the fragile chaos phenomenon, the ACCM-Ikeda time delay system has better dynamical complexity and larger connected chaotic parameter spaces (connectedness means that there is no stripe corresponding to nonchaotic dynamics embedded in the chaos regions).},

  abstract         = {This paper tackles the difficult but important task of objective algorithm performance assessment for optimization. Rather than reporting average performance of algorithms across a set of chosen instances, which may bias conclusions, we propose a methodology to enable the strengths and weaknesses of different optimization algorithms to be compared across a broader instance space. The results reported in a recent Computers and Operations Research paper comparing the performance of graph coloring heuristics are revisited with this new methodology to demonstrate (i) how pockets of the instance space can be found where algorithm performance varies significantly from the average performance of an algorithm; (ii) how the properties of the instances can be used to predict algorithm performance on previously unseen instances with high accuracy; and (iii) how the relative strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm can be visualized and measured objectively.},

The question is, though, how diverse and challenging are these time series, and do they enable us to study the unique strengths and weaknesses of different forecasting methods? This paper proposes a visualisation method for collections of time series that enables a time series to be represented as a point in a two-dimensional instance space. The effectiveness of different forecasting methods across this space is easy to visualise, and the diversity of the time series in an existing collection can be assessed. Noting that the diversity of the M3 dataset has been questioned, this paper also proposes a method for generating new time series with controllable characteristics in order to fill in and spread out the instance space, making our generalisations of forecasting method performances as robust as possible.},

  abstract         = {Classical method of Lyapunov exponents spectrum estimation for a n-th-order continuous-time, smooth dynamical system involves Gram–Schmidt orthonormalization and calculations of perturbations lengths logarithms. In this paper, we have shown that using a new, simplified method, it is possible to estimate full spectrum of n Lyapunov exponents by integration of \$\$(n-1)\$\$perturbations only. In particular, it is enough to integrate just one perturbation to obtain two largest Lyapunov exponents, which enables to search for hyperchaos. Moreover, in the presented algorithm, only very basic mathematical operations such as summation, multiplication or division are applied, which boost the efficiency of computations. All these features together make the new method faster than any other known by the authors if the order of the system under consideration is low. Correctness the method has been tested for three examples: Lorenz system, Duffing oscillator and three Duffing oscillators coupled in the ring scheme. Moreover, efficiency of the method has been confirmed by two practical tests. It has been revealed that for low-order systems, the presented method is faster than any other known by authors.},
